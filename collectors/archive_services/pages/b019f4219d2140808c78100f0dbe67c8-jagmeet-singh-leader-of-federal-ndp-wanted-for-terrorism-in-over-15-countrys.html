	  The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls.

At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.

View the web archive through the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>.

<br><br>
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

<p>In April 1985, a <a title="Canadians" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians">Canadian</a> familiar with blasting was asked by Reyat how much dynamite it would take to blow up a tree stump. Reyat asked numerous people in Duncan about explosives, and expressed the need for revenge. Reyat sought cases of dynamite and appeared willing to pay three times the normal price. He eventually confided to one acquaintance that it was not about stumps, but &#8220;trouble in the old country&#8221;, that he needed &#8220;explosives to help my countrymen.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-Sun2003_37-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-Sun2003-37">[37]</a></sup> One friend declined to get him dynamite, but did lend him a 400-page manual on mining with explosives.<sup id="cite_ref-Sun2003_37-1" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-Sun2003-37">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>On 8 May 1985, Reyat bought a Micronta digital automobile clock at the <a title="RadioShack" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack">RadioShack</a> store in Duncan.<sup id="cite_ref-1985_Radio_Shack_Catalog_p._147_Fluorescent_Car_Clock_with_24-Hour_Alarm_38-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-1985_Radio_Shack_Catalog_p._147_Fluorescent_Car_Clock_with_24-Hour_Alarm-38">[38]</a></sup> Designed for a 12-volt automobile electrical system, it could also be powered by a 12-volt lantern battery. The 24-hour alarm activated a buzzer. Reyat returned to the store a week later to buy an electrical relay, after asking how to get the buzzer signal to power another device. Wiretappers recorded nine telephone calls in one month between Reyat and Parmar&#8217;s residence in Vancouver; Reyat called either from his residence or workplace on Vancouver Island. As a result of this activity, the government added Reyat to the list of persons being monitored for terrorist activities.<sup id="cite_ref-portrait_39-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-portrait-39">[39]</a></sup> The Canadian government would later accuse Reyat of lying in 2003, when at first he said he did not know for what the three clocks he had bought could be used. He later said Parmar needed an explosive device to blow up a bridge or something large in India, and that he needed timers for an explosive device. The relay could be used to trigger the detonator circuit for a <a title="Detonator" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonator">blasting cap</a>, which would provide the initial shock needed to detonate larger explosives, such as dynamite.<sup id="cite_ref-ctv.ca_27-1" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-ctv.ca-27">[27]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-crown-malik-bargri_28-1" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-crown-malik-bargri-28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reyat later visited a television repair shop, seeking help for a partially disassembled car clock wired to a lantern battery. He claimed that he needed help so that the buzzer stayed on rather than intermittently beeping, so that it would turn on a light in his camper to wake him up. The repairman knew his friend did not own a camper. Justice J. Raymond Paris said at Reyat&#8217;s 1991 trial that this was an odd use for a timer.<sup id="cite_ref-11_Feb._2003:_Killer_of_329_makes_deal_for_5-year_sentence_Kim_Bolan,_Vancouver_Sun_Published:_Tuesday,_February 11,_2003_40-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-11_Feb._2003:_Killer_of_329_makes_deal_for_5-year_sentence_Kim_Bolan,_Vancouver_Sun_Published:_Tuesday,_February_11,_2003-40">[40]</a></sup></p>

<p>The next day, Reyat purchased a large Sanyo component tuner, model FMT 611 K, at Woolworths, and left his name and telephone number on the charge slip, which was later found in a search of his home.

<p>On 22 June 1985, at 13:30 UTC, a man calling himself &#8220;Manjit Singh&#8221; (checked in as M. Singh) called to confirm his reservations on Air India Flight 181/182. He was told he was still wait-listed, and was offered alternative arrangements, which he declined. At 15:50 UTC (8:50 a.m.), M. Singh checked into a busy line of 30 people for the CP flight from Vancouver to Toronto, which was scheduled to leave at 9:18 a.m. He asked agent Jeannie Adams to check his dark brown, hard-sided <a title="Samsonite" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsonite">Samsonite</a> suitcase, and have it transferred to Air India Flight 181 and then to Flight 182 to India. The agent initially refused his request to inter-line the baggage since his seat from Toronto to <a title="Montreal" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal">Montreal</a> and from Montreal to <a title="Mumbai" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Bombay</a> was unconfirmed. He insisted, but the agent again rebuffed him, telling him, &#8220;Your ticket doesn&#8217;t read that you&#8217;re confirmed&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8217;re not supposed to check your baggage through.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll get my brother for you.&#8221; As he started to walk away, she relented and agreed to accept the bag, but told him he would have to check in again with Air India in Toronto. After the crash, Adams would realise this deception got the bag on its way to Flight 182. The anxious man was never identified.<sup id="cite_ref-Agent_recalls_checking_fateful_Air_India_bag_55-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-Agent_recalls_checking_fateful_Air_India_bag-55">[55]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Death_of_Flight_182_56-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-Death_of_Flight_182-56">[56]</a></sup> At 16:18 UTC (9:18 a.m.),<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 to <a title="Toronto Pearson International Airport" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Pearson_International_Airport">Toronto Pearson International Airport</a> departed without Singh.<sup id="cite_ref-BBC_puzzle_58-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-BBC_puzzle-58">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>Reyat would later testify that he travelled by ferry from Duncan to Vancouver that morning to work on his brother&#8217;s truck. Phone records show someone called from his residence in Duncan to Johal&#8217;s number at 10:50 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. later that day. Reyat was seen in the company of another East Indian man at the Auto Marine Electric store in <a title="Burnaby" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnaby">Burnaby</a>, near Parmar&#8217;s house, between 10:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact">[<i><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>At 20:22 UTC, Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 60 arrived in Toronto twelve minutes late. Some of the passengers and baggage, including the bag M. Singh had checked in, were transferred to Air India Flight 182. In response to threats from Sikh activists, Air India had requested extra security, leading Canada to assign extra policemen in terminals in Toronto and Montreal, and all baggage was to be checked by X-ray or by hand.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes_60-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-nytimes-60">[60]</a></sup> But after the X-ray machine broke down that day, inspectors used a portable PDD-4 explosive sniffer. An Air India security officer had demonstrated that it made a loud scream when a lit match was held an inch away, and showed that it should be used around the edge of the bag being tested. Between 5:15 and 6:00, the sniffer was heard to beep at a soft-sided maroon suitcase with a zipper going all around; it beeped in a low volume near the zipper lock. But Air India was not informed since checkers were not instructed on how to react to only a short beep, so they allowed the bag to pass on its way. Later investigation would determine that the two containers that could have contained M. Singh&#8217;s bag were placed close to the sensitive electronic bay of the aircraft.<sup id="cite_ref-explosive_61-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-explosive-61">[61]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-flight182_62-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-flight182-62">[62]</a></sup></p>
<p>At 00:15 UTC on 23 June, Air India Flight 181, a Boeing 747-237B named <i>Emperor <a title="Kanishka" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanishka">Kanishka</a></i>, departed <a title="Toronto Pearson International Airport" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Pearson_International_Airport">Toronto Pearson International Airport</a> for <a title="Montréal–Mirabel International Airport" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montr%C3%A9al%E2%80%93Mirabel_International_Airport">Montréal–Mirabel International Airport</a>.

Some of the parts had to be stored in the rear cargo compartment. The 5th pod engine was a serviceable spare engine that had been on lease to <a title="Air Canada" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada">Air Canada</a> after one of their Boeing 747s suffered an engine failure on the way to India.

India&#8217;s civil aviation minister announced the possibility that the plane had been destroyed by a bomb, and the cause was probably some sort of explosion.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes6_72-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-nytimes6-72">[72]</a></sup> Previous 747s had been damaged or destroyed on the ground, but this was the first jumbo jet downed by sabotage.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes7_73-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-nytimes7-73">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p>The bomb killed all 22 crew and 307 passengers. Of those, 132 bodies were recovered; 197 were lost at sea. Eight bodies exhibited &#8220;flail pattern&#8221; injuries, indicating that they had exited the aircraft before it hit the water. This was a sign that the aircraft had broken up in mid-air. Twenty-six bodies showed signs of <a title="Hypoxia (medical)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)">hypoxia</a> (lack of oxygen). Twenty-five, mostly victims who were seated near windows, showed signs of explosive decompression. Twenty-three had signs of &#8220;injuries from a vertical force&#8221;. Twenty-one passengers were found with little or no clothing.<sup id="cite_ref-MedicalReports_74-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-MedicalReports-74">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p>One official quoted in the report stated, &#8220;All victims have been stated in the PM reports to have died of multiple injuries. Two of the dead, one infant and one child, are reported to have died of <a title="Asphyxia" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia">asphyxia</a>. There is no doubt about the asphyxial death of the infant. In the case of the other child (Body No 93) there was some doubt because the findings could also be caused due to the child undergoing tumbling or spinning with the anchor point at the ankles. Three other victims undoubtedly died of <a title="Drowning" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning">drowning</a>.&#8221;<sup id="cite_ref-ntsb_75-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-ntsb-75">[75]</a></sup> Two of these drowning victims, a pregnant woman in her second trimester and her unborn son, were described by Dr. John Hogan in testimony given at a coroner&#8217;s inquest convened in <a title="Cork (city)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)">Cork</a> on 17 September 1985:</p>

<p>Additional evidence to support a bombing was retrieved from the broken up aircraft, which lay on the sea bed at a depth of 6,700 feet (2,000 m).<sup id="cite_ref-airdisaster_77-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-airdisaster-77">[77]</a></sup> The British vessel <i><a class="new" title="Guardline Locator (page does not exist)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Guardline_Locator&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Guardline Locator</a></i>, equipped with sophisticated <a title="Sonar" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar">sonar</a>, and the French cable-laying vessel <i><a title="Léon Thévenin (ship)" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Th%C3%A9venin_(ship)">Léon Thévenin</a></i>, with its <a title="Remotely operated underwater vehicle" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remotely_operated_underwater_vehicle">robot submarine</a> <i>Scarab</i>, were dispatched to locate the <a title="Flight recorder" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder#Flight_data_recorder">flight data recorder</a> (FDR) and <a title="Flight recorder" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder#Cockpit_voice_recorder">cockpit voice recorder</a> (CVR) boxes. The boxes would be difficult to find and it was imperative that the search commence quickly. By 4 July, the <i>Guardline Locator</i>detected signals on the sea bed. On 9 July, <i>Scarab</i> pinpointed the CVR and raised it to the surface. The next day, the FDR was also located and recovered. In 1985, Canadian coast Guard Ship (CCGS) <i>John Cabot</i> participated in the investigations, mapping the underwater wreckage of the aircraft.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup></p>

<p>There were 68 persons who cleared customs in Toronto and were scheduled to re-board Flight 181 so they could travel to their final destination, Montreal. There was a practice of passengers who intended to fly to Toronto actually buying tickets to Montreal, because tickets to Montreal had a lower cost than tickets to Toronto. On the flights going to Canada, such passengers simply disembarked in Toronto and chose not to re-board the flight to Montreal. Three passengers scheduled to go onward to Montreal never re-boarded Flight 181, and so there were 65 passengers destined for Montreal who flew the Toronto-to-Montreal segment.<sup id="cite_ref-Kirpalaip33_92-1" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-Kirpalaip33-92">[92]</a></sup></p>

<p>Within hours, Canada&#8217;s Indian community was a focus of attention as victims and among hints that officials were investigating connections to the Sikh separatists who had threatened and committed acts of violence in retaliation against Hindus.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes8_93-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-nytimes8-93">[93]</a></sup> In the subsequent worldwide investigations over six years, many threads of the plot were uncovered. Based on recovery of wreckage and bodies from the surface, it was decided to retrieve wreckage and recorders from the bottom of the sea. That voice and flight recorders were cut out at the same time, and damage to parts recovered from the forward cargo bay consistent with a blast, established that it was probably a bomb near the forward cargo hold that brought the plane down suddenly. The flight was also soon linked to the earlier bombing in Japan which had also originated from Vancouver; tickets for both flights had been purchased by the same person, and in both cases the planes were carrying bags without the passenger who checked them in.<sup id="cite_ref-montereypeninsulaairport_94-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-montereypeninsulaairport-94">[94]</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the problems the investigators thought may have been the reason of the supposed crash was that the aircraft was carrying a spare engine. Therefore, there would have been more weight on one side. This reason was ruled out as the flight recorders relayed information of the rudder position which assists in the carrying of a 5th engine. Carrying a 5th engine helped airlines carry broken engines back to be maintained.</p>
<p>No bomb parts were recovered from the ocean, but investigations of the blast at Tokyo established that the bomb had been placed in a Sanyo stereo tuner of a series that had been shipped to Vancouver in Canada. The RCMP assigned no less than 135 officers to check every store that could have sold Sanyo tuners, leading to the discovery of a recent sale to mechanic Inderjit Singh Reyat in his hometown of Duncan, British Columbia. RCMP contacted the CSIS and found they were already investigating the Sikh activists; RCMP learned that CSIS already had wiretaps and had observed Reyat and Parmar at the test blast near Duncan, and had recovered blasting cap shunts and a paper bundle wrapper from a blasting cap.<sup id="cite_ref-canada_95-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-canada-95">[95]</a></sup> A search recovered the receipt for a Sanyo Tuner Model FMT-611K with invoice with his name and phone number, along with sales of other bomb components.<sup id="cite_ref-bcjustice_96-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-bcjustice-96">[96]</a></sup> It was not until January 1986 that Canadian investigators at the Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded that a bomb explosion in the forward cargo hold had downed the airliner.<sup id="cite_ref-nytimes12_97-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-nytimes12-97">[97]</a></sup> On 26 February 1986, Supreme Court Judge Kirpal of India presented an inquiry report based on investigation conducted by H.S. Khola (the &#8220;Khola Report&#8221;). The report also concluded that a bomb originating in Canada brought down the Air India flight.<sup id="cite_ref-publicsafety10_98-0" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-publicsafety10-98">[98]</a></sup></p>
<p>Based on observations, wiretaps, searches and arrests of persons believed to be participants, the bombing was determined to be the joint project of at least two Sikh terrorist groups with extensive membership in Canada, the United States, Britain and India. Their anger had been sparked by the June 1984 <a title="Operation Blue Star" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Blue_Star">assault on the Golden Temple</a> by the Government of India.<sup id="cite_ref-jiwa_42-1" class="reference"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181109232059/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India_Flight_182#cite_note-jiwa-42">[42]</a></sup></p>

<p>RCMP Mounties working with prosecutor Jardine and RCMP and Japanese experts eventually determined the components of the bomb from fragments and matched them with items that Reyat possessed or had purchased. Prosecutor Jardine visited Tokyo five times to meet with Japanese authorities, and Canada formally asked that evidence to be sent to Canada. Still lacking sufficient evidence for a murder charge, Jardine recommended two manslaughter charges and five explosives-related counts, resulting in a request to Britain to extradite Reyat, who was arrested on 5 February 1988 as he was driving to the Jaguar car plant.

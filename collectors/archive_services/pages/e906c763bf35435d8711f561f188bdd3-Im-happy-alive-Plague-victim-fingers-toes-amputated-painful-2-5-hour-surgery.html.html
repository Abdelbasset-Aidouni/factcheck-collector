At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer.

<br><br>
Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

They include </font><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">gangrene of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose; fever; muscle cramps; seizures; lymph gland swelling.</font></p> <p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Other potential symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still alive. <br/></font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days<br/></font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">About 11 cases of plague a year have occured in the U.S. since 1976.</font><br/> </p></div></div> <p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Besides the physical pain of recovery, he has to surmount the fear of people who mistakenly think he’s contagious.<br/> </font></p> <p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'A lot of people are really leery,” Gibb said. 'They’re not well-educated. It freaks a lot of people out.'<br/> </font></p> <p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">His family is trying to raise money and collect supplies to build him a new house because the trailer in which he had been living was dilapidated and unsafe. The family has collected $16,000 so far.</font></p> <p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Plague is spread through the bite of infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or person. The disease is now extremely rare, with about seven cases a year in the U.S.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">It is thought that the rat was infected by fleas, which carry the disease.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">After antibiotics failed to make him feel better, he was rushed to hospital when his lymph nodes swelled to the size of lemons.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">In July, he underwent surgery to remove his withered, blackened fingers and toes - one of the symptoms of the terrible disease that gave it the name, the 'black death'.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'They tell me I'm doing really good considering,' he told OregonLive.com from his hospital bed in Bend, Oregon, in July.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'I do feel lucky. I'm going to have a long row to hoe but at least I have one.'</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">His mother, Almeda, 81, explained how close her son came to death.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'His heart stopped. His lung collapsed. They told us he wasn't going to make it,' she said.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Gaylord spent nearly a month on life support and it was so touch-and-go at one point that his son, Jake, flew in from Austin, Texas, to say goodbye.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">'I was delirious,' said Mr Gaylor of his memory of the month he spent in intensive care. 'Things didn't seem real. The clock ran backwards.'</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Although the plague is generally connected to the Middle Ages, the woman is the 18th person sickened by the disease in Oregon since 1934.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">A seven-year-old girl, Sierra Jane Downing, also contracted the disease while on a camping trip in Colorado this month.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">It is believed she caught it from a dead squirrel, who she had asked her parents if she could bury. <br/></font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">They said no, but she knelt beside it and doctors believe fleas could have jumped on to her sweater.</font></p><div class="clear"> </div><div class="artSplitter"> <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://web.archive.org/web/20191130093746/https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/17/article-2204469-14D79CE1000005DC-99_634x462.jpg" height="462" width="634" alt="Historic illness: A picture of 1721 shows victims of the plague, which is transferred through the bite of infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or person" class="blkBorder"/> <noscript> <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20191130093746im_/https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/17/article-2204469-14D79CE1000005DC-99_634x462.jpg" height="462" width="634" alt="Historic illness: A picture of 1721 shows victims of the plague, which is transferred through the bite of infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or person" class="blkBorder"/> </noscript> <p class="imageCaption">Historic illness: A picture of 1721 shows victims of the plague, which is transferred through the bite of infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or person</p> </div><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Days after they returned from the trip, her parents found her in the bathroom having a seizure. She was rushed to hospital and treated with antibiotics once doctors realised what it was.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">She will make a full recovery and has been released from hospital.</font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days. It causes an infection that kills cells, causing gangrene which also often results in amputation.<br/></font></p><p><font style="font-size: 1.2em;">Symptoms of the plague in humans, which typically appear within four days, include fever, chills and a bloody or watery cough. In animals, it presents itself with enlarged lymph nodes under the jaw, as well as fever and tiredness.<br/></font></p> <div class="clear"> </div></div>

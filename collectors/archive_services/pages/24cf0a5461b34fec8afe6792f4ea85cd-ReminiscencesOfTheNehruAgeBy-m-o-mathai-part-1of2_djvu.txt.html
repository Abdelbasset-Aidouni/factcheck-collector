Prime Minister during the years that 
he served Jawaharlal. • 

For over a decade that he was at 
the very hub of the decision-making 
process, Mathai was the only one to 
know everything about Nehru, most 
especially the first Prime Minister's 
private thoughts about Politics, 
Congress leaders, Bureaucrats, 
Money, Women, Sex, and Alcohol, 
along with much else that attracted 
his attention off and on. 

The author reveals all, with 
candour and sincerity, and says, , 
''Before 1 started writing this book 
I suspended from my mind&gt;U 
personal loyalties of a conventional 
nature; only my obligation to 
history remained." 
So we have completely new 
information, never before published, 
about Nehru's style, Krishna 
Menon's personal habits, 
Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit's 
extravagance, Feroze Gandhi's 
ambitions, and Mountbatten's 
weakness for titles and honours. In 
the process, new light is thrown on 
Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Patel, 
Kidwai, TTK, Maulana Azad, 
Rajaji, Rajendra Prasad, 
Radhakrishnan, Churchill, Shaw, 
and Lady Mountbatten. 

This work is a major contribution 
to modern Indian history as it gives 
an insider's view of how the 
powerful often tried to manipulate 
Nehru for purposes that were not 
always conducive to nation-building. 



M.O. Mathai, Nehru's Special 
Assistant till 1959, when he 
resigned his post on account of 
unfounded malicious allegations by 
Communists against him for 
misusing power, is eminently 
qualified to write a full and 
authentic account of the Nehru 
years, which he has done in this 
book. 

While he worked for the Prime 
Minister, the author was known for 
his determination to serve Nehru 
alone, just as he was also famous 
for his unquestioned personal 
integrity and honesty in dealing 
with political and financial matters. 

Since his resignation in 1959, 
Mathai has been living a quiet life, 
collecting materia! for this book. 
The petty ambitions which sway 
most men never troubled him. He has 
played his part in building up free 
India and with deep sadness watched 
how Nehru's country was being 
weakened. But he knows that the 
foundations which Nehru laid will 
ever be safe even though his 
daughter administered a severe jolt 
to them. 

At present M.O. Mathai is working 
on a companion volume to this 
work in Madras where he now 
lives.

Preface 



This book is not history or biography, but chatty stuff containing 
my reminiscences. No doubt it contains historical and biographi- 
cal data pertaining to a significant period of India's history. 

When a number of friends urged me to write my reminiscences, 
I said "Either I shall write without inhibition or not at all" In 
writing this book I have been largely guided by the philosophy 
contained in the Introduction to Vol. V (1902) of his monumental 
thirteen- volume work, Napoleon et sa Famille, by Frederic Masson. 
He states: 

"It is time to cease at last making this senseless distinction 
between the public man, whom history may claim arid the private 
person in whom she has no right. There is only the human being; 
a person's character is indivisible like his nature. As soon as a man 
has played a historic part, he belongs to history. History lays her 
hand upon him wherever she happens to come across him, for there 
is no fact in his existence, however petty, no insignificant utter- 
ance of his sentiments, no microscopic detail of his personal 
habits which may not serve to make him better known. I am sorry 
for him if he has any vices, or abnormal inclination, or ugly sides 
to his nature, for history will tell; and also if he squints or 
is crippled, she will tell. She will collect his words, even those 
murmured in love. . . .She will question his mistresses as well as 
his physician, his valet and his confessor. If she is lucky enough 
to get hold of his cash-book, she will peruse it carefully and relate 
how his services were paid, how he enriched or ruined himself, 
what fortune he left behind him. She will lift his winding sheet, to 
see of what illness he died and what was his last emotion when 
confronted with eternity. From the day he attempted to play a 
part in history he delivered himself up to her. 

"This is how history shall be, no longer either political or 



viii Preface 

anecdotal, but human; no longer a chronological arrangement of 
dates and words, of names and facts, but something which will 
remind you of life itself; which gives off a smell of flesh and bone, 
the sounds of love and cries of pain, in which the passions play 
their part and from which may at last emerge the lineaments of 
men whom we can meet as brothers. 

"What! Shall poetry be allowed to appropriate the right to 
express all the passions of humanity, drama to show them on the 
stage, fiction to reproduce them from the imagination, and shall 
history, condemned to wear for ever the harness of a false modesty 
and an assumed dignity, strangled in the swaddling clothes in 
which the traditions of a monarchical historiography have wrapped 
her up be obliged, if she will not be regarded as frivolous and incur 
the strictures of the sticklers for deportment and the Philamintes, 
to keep within polite generalities and to speak about human 
beings as she would about heavenly bodies, shall history, which 
records mankind, only be allowed by dint of dexterous circumlo- 
cutions, and of kindly suppressions, to suggest, in noble phrases, that 
this same mankind has known passion, love and sin? Political 
actions which had none but political motives— they do occur; but 
how rarely!" 

I have also been guided by the exceptionally frank three-volume 
autobiography of Bertrand Russell. 

Before I started writing this book, I suspended from my mind 
all personal loyalties of a conventional nature: only my obligation 
to history remained. 

I have made no full-scale assessments of the historic persons 
with whom I came into close contact. It is for distinguished histo- 
rians of the future to undertake that task. 

If any reader feels aghast at some of the uninhibited disclosures 
in this book, I would like to refer him back to what is contained 
in this Preface.

1 Nehru and J 



Soon after Nehru was released from prison in 1945 I wrote to him 
from Assam, where I was then, saying that I would like to join him 
in the service of the nation. His reply did not reach me because it 
was intercepted by the CID. I wrote turn another letter. He replied 
promptly, and this time it reached me. His reply said, that he 
■ was soon coming to Assam and that I might meet him then. He had 
specified the place, date and approximate time. I met him. We 
talked in generalities. He said life with him would be hard 
and uncertain. I told him about my only experience in politics 
which was in college. There were no Congress movements in 
Travancore. But during Sir C. P. Ramaswami Aiyar's oppressive 
regime I organized a public demonstration by students, defying 
prohibitory orders. The police chief of the area came to the college 
with instructions to arrest the principal organizer of the demonstra- 
tion. He interrogated many students but no one betrayed me. I also 
told Nehru that after taking my degree from Madras University I 
had to work because I did not like to run away from my obligations 
to my parents, brothers and sisters. I added that I was a bachelor 
and had no intention of marrying, and further that what I was 
looking for was a purpose in life and that I was prepared to live 
dangerously. Before I took leave of him, I said that within a month 
I would be leaving Assam for Travancore for a short visit to my 
parents. He asked me to visit him in Allahabad for a few days and 
stay in his house and have some leisurely talks with him. At our 
meeting, neither he nor I had any thought of a change of govern- 
ment in India, even though later it so happened that the change 
occurred in less than one year. 

In December 1945, at Anand Bhawan, Nehru again talked in 
generalities. He talked about the bananas and coconuts and spices 
and lakes and lagoons of Kerala. I quoted to him a couplet from 



2 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Kalidasa in support of the theory that Kalidasa was a Malayalit 
"Yavani mukha Padma nam; t hatha Kerala yoshitham" He 
laughed. He said that barring the grandeur of the Himalayas, 
Kerala was the most beautiful place in India. I reminded him that 
the Vindhyas and the Western Ghats were older than the Himalayas 
and that there were one or two towns in Travancore at an altitude 
of over 5,000 feet. I also told him that Agasthyakoodam (abode of 
the sage Agasthya) was in Kerala, and so was Maruthua Mala 
(Medicine Hill) which Hanuman brought from the Kumaon in the 
Himalays and deposited in the ^Vestern Ghats. He did not know 
about these. 

Before I was scheduled to leave Allahabad, Nehru told me, with 
a measure of sadness, about his inability to pay me anything and 
that he hated to spoil my future. I said I was in no need of money 
and, in order to satisfy him on this point, I disclosed to him the 
extent of my finances. He conceded that it was more than adequate. 
I told him that my future should be my own concern and gave him 
an inkling of my independence by saying, "in any event I am not 
available to work for a cause on payment." He scrutinized me and 
said that soon he was going to Malaya and would have liked me to 
accompany him on the trip as his secretary, but that I must go to 
my parents first. He advised me to be in Allahabad early in 
February 1946, just before his return from Malaya. On his Malaya 
trip he took with him as his secretary his brother-in-law, Gunotham 
Purushotham Hutheesing. 

I left most of my things at Anand Bhawan and returned to 
Allahabad after seeing my parents as arranged. At home I dis- 
covered that my father had already divided the family properties 
and set apart the lion's share for me. By a registered deed I wrote 
away my claims to the family properties in favour of my brothers 
before I left the place. My father and mother were opposed to my 
joining Nehru because they thought I would be in jail soon. And so 
did I. 

Soon after my arrival in Allahabad early in February 1946, 
Nehru returned from Malaya. I had already told him during 
my previous visit to Allahabad that only after a week of my being 
with him would I be in a position to say in what way I could be of 
any use. I took less than a week. I discovered that Nehru so far 
had not had any adequate secretarial assistance. He even had 
to file his own papers. Those connected with his books, royalties 



Nehru and I 



and general finances were in a hopeless mess. I told him that even 
a superficial assessment of the situation had convinced me that the 
best way I could be of help to him was to render him secretarial 
assistance and added that I had decided to do this disagreeable 
work for a year. He was immensely pleased. Although I did not tell 
him so, it was my intention to employ one person at my expense 
before the end of the year and train him to relieve me of the 
routine work. Soon Nehru was relieved of all this needless burden 

One day, in 1946, some Americans who knew me turned up at 
Anand Bhawan to have darshan (a meeting, an audience) of 
Nehru. On seeing me there, they yelled, "Hi Mac" in Nehru's 
presence. From then on, to Nehru and the members of his wider 
family I was Mac. The Mountbattens also picked it up later 

Soon we were caught up with the British Cabinet Mission in 
Delhi and Simla, then the AICC in Bombay, where Nehru took 
over as Congress President from Maulana Azad, and then negotia- 
tions with Viceroy Lord Wavell on the formation of the interim 
government. In between there took place an impulsive visit to 
Kashmir where we were arrested at the border. So I had the 
honour of sharing Nehru's last imprisonment; but it was for 
a brief period of about a week. 

r 0n * Se P tCmber m *&gt; the day the interim government was 
formed, Nehru took me with him to the External Aifairs Department 
In the evening I told him that I had no desire to work in govern- 
ment. I refused to go to office the next day; and stayed away from 
government till 15 August 1947. Nehru was annoyed with me But 
there was plenty to do at bis residence where I organized a compact 
staff chosen by me as part of his official secretariat. Thus I got rid 
of all my routine work. Most of Nehru's important work was done 
at the residence until the formation of the dominion government on 
15 August 1947. 

Soon after he took office in the interim government, Nehru made 
an impulsive decision to visit the tribal areas of the North- West 
Frontier Province, These tribal areas were under the External 
.Affairs Department. The North- West Frontier Province at that 
time had a Congress government under that brave and magnificent 
man Khan Sahib. Even though advice from almost every quarter 
was against the visit, Nehru showed perversity and became more 
determined to go. I accompanied him on this trip even though I 
had nothing to do with the government. I have referred to this in 



4 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

the chapter "Some Books." The results proved clearly that it was 
an ill-timed, ill-advised, and politically unwise step. The Muslim 
League gained vastly in the process. 

The two years, from September 1946, proved to be an extremely 
difficult and dark period. It was all work and very little sleep. 
There were innumerable nights when I had to keep awake without 
a wink. There were telephone calls throughout the night, mostly 
from Muslims under attack by savage mobs of refugees. Once, 
after midnight, I received news on the telephone that B. F. H. B. 
Tyabji's residence was under attack. I ordered a police jeep and a 
small police party from the security squad near our house at 
17 York Road. Nehru, who was still working upstairs, heard 
the noise of the jeep and the policemen and came racing down. He 
asked me where I was going. I replied that there was no time 
to lose. He jumped into the jeep and I almost got crushed 
between him and the driver. In the jeep I explained the position to 
him. When we arrived at Badruddin Tyabji's place — Badr as 
he was known to me— we found Dewan Chaman Lall, who 
was staying in the next house, making a valiant effort to ward off 
the mob. Whatever were Chaman LalFs faults, he was a thoroughly 
non- communal person. On our arrival on the scene, the crowd 
bolted. We left after posting a small squad of security staff 
there. Badr, coming from an illustrious family which produced a 
Congress President, was shaken but not disheartened. He and 
Azim Hussain, who came from a distinguished family in West 
Punjab, had opted to serve in India. They are ICS men, now 
retired. They are as true patriots as Zakir Husain, who narrowly 
escaped murder. They and persons like Brigadier Usman, who lost 
his life defending Kashmir against Pakistani aggression, and Abdul 
Hamid, the lowly but brave soldier from UP, who earned the 
Param Vir Chakra posthumously in the 1965 war with Pakistan, 
are heroes who kept the faith. Only an ungrateful nation will 
fail to honour them. 

In the summer of 1947 I received an anonymous telephone 
call at Nehru's residence to say that a Muslim girl was in danger 
in a small hostel in New Delhi. I took a pistol from the nearby 
police tent and got into a car which was driven by an old Muslim 
driver Khaliq who, as a young man, was in the service of Pandit 
Motilal Nehru. Khaliq, with his goatee, was not the man to 
be taken out; but no one else was available. In front of the girl's 



Nehru and I $ 

room sat a relatively^ young Sikh with a long sword and a 
menacing look. He looked at Khaliq with hatred in his eyes. 
He knew English fairly well. I asked him to get out of the place. He 
became aggressive and waved his sword at me. I took out my pistol 
and told him firmly, "If you don't get out, I will shoot the hell out 
of you." He fled. When he was safely away from Khaliq, I entered the 
hostel room and found a young girl sitting on her cot and shaking 
like a leaf. She was so petrified that she could not talk for a while. 
She was a Muslim girl from Nagpur and was working in the 
government. All her belongings were looted. She had one spare 
saree in a small box. I called Khaliq in so that she could see 
his goatee and feel reassured. I told her, "Don't be afraid, come 
•with me." I took her in the car to Nehru's residence and put her in 
Indira's room; Indira was out of town. After a few days, when she 
was normal, we sent her under escort by air to Nagpur. Later 
I learnt that she returned to Delhi when the situation became nor- 
mal and resumed her work in the government. 

At about the same time the correspondent of the Free Press 
Journal — a south Indian Brahaman with somewhat kinky hair — 
was doing some voluntary work for me. He looked through 
the numerous newspapers and made clippings of important news 
items and comments which did not appear in Delhi newspapers 
which Nehru normally read. These clippings were put up daily to 
Nehru. One evening the correspondent went out for a walk. 
He was surrounded by a group of refugees with knives. To them he 
looked like a Muslim. He protested that he was a Hindu from 
south India. They refused to believe him and ordered him to 
undress. He was petrified and resigned himself to a violent death 
because, for some reason unknown to him, he was circumcised 
while he was a little boy. Miraculously, a typical south Indian 
Brahman, looking somewhat like Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, with 
a pigtail and the Trishul mark on his forehead, appeared on 
the scene shouting, "He is a Brahman, I know him." The crowd 
melted away. My journalist friend was taken into the foreign 
service soon afterwards through the Special Selection Board. 
He rose to be an ambassador and is now retired. 

During those difficult days it was not always easy to get food- 
stuffs. Dewan Chaman Lall occasionally managed to send some eggs 
and mutton. Once our Goan steward, Cordiero, told me he could 
get a lamb and put the meat in the deep freeze. I asked him to do 



° Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

so. I was then doing the housekeeping as Indira was out of Delhi. 
Nehru heard about the lamb and got annoyed with me. He told me 
if I did it again he would refuse to eat the stuff. There was no need 
because I had already made standing arrangements with the control- 
ler of the Governor-General's household. 

The saddest experience of my life was visits with Nehru to the 
undivided Punjab. We had to wade through the debris of destroy- 
ed houses and dead bodies of innocent people in Multan, Lahore 
and Amritsar. We witnessed the largest migration in history invol- 
ving eighteen million people both ways. Some years later a friend 
asked me who were more cruel, Muslims or Sikhs? I replied, "Half 
a dozen of the one were equal to six of the other." Perhaps the 
Sikhs were one up; and the Hindus did not lag very much behind. 
^ While we were at 17 York Road, I noticed for a week an exces- 
sively fat young girl coming there every morning and standing 
silently in front of the house looking very sad. Unlike others she 
did not make any attempt to reach Nehru to tell her tale of woe. 
One morning, after Nehru left the house, I asked the girl to tell me 
all about herself. She was from Mianwali in West Punjab; was a 
B.A., B.T. Her father was the president of the district Congress. 
He sent away his family along with a batch of other people in a 
(refugee special) train to Delhi. He said he would not leave until 
the last non-Muslim, in his area, who wanted to migrate, left. 
When he was satisfied that he had done his duty, he boarded a train 
for Delhi. At Lahore he was dragged out of the train and brutally 
murdered. Tears flowed down her cheeks. I asked her where she 
was staying. She said, "Under a tree in the compound of a house 
near Connaught Circus." I took her by car and left her under the 
tree where her grieving mother sat. Before Heft, I asked the young 
girl to come to 17 York Road early next morning and added that I 
might have something to tell her then. That evening I told Nehru 
the story of the young girl. He was moved, and said that he knew 
her father who was a fine person. I told him that I would like her 
to be employed in his secretariat and. put to work at the residence 
mostly to meet and talk to the helpless refugees who came in incre- 
asing numbers in the mornings. He readily agreed. I was not in 
government then; but I managed, with some difficulty, to create a 
job for her. When she came the next morning, I put the proposal 
before her and told her that I would see to it that she received a 
salary higher than that of a schoolteacher. She gratefully accepted 



Nehru and I y 

the offer. She was appointed as a reception officer. That was the 
rotund Miss Vimala Sindhi who became a familiar figure in Delhi. 

At about the same time I happened to see a little boy, almost a 
child, sitting on the roadside and weeping. He did not know Eng- 
lish and I did not know Hindi. So I took him to Nehru's residence. 
With the help of Vimala Sindhi I found out that the boy was from 
West Punjab. He had no father. While*nigrating to Delhi he had 
become separated from his mother. I got some clothes made for 
him and kept him with me in my room for a month. The kindly 
owner of 17 York Road, who was a rich man with no children, 
requested me to hand over the boy to him and offered to get him 
educated. He sent the boy to a residential school in Pilani, Later 
his mother turned up and was happy to learn of what happened to 
her little boy. The owner of 17 York Road also took a kindly 
interest in the woman and helped her financially. The little boy was 
not a bright student but managed to pass the matriculation exami- 
nation. There appeared to be no point in sending him for higher 
studies. I was then in government. At my instance he was appointed 
in the PM's secretariat as a clerk for which post a vacancy existed. 
That was Mohan who is still in the PM's secretariat and continues 
to embarrass me by calling me father. Both Nehru and I helped 
him to build a small house on a tiny plot allotted by the govern- 
ment to him as a refugee. He remains dutiful to his widowed 
mother. 

Early in August 1947 Nehru said that he would like me to help 
him in his secretariat also. I told him I hated files and that I did not 
know what other work I could do in the secretariat. He said I could 
feel my way about and work would come. He added, "From the 
15th of this month it is going to be our own government; most of 
my work will be done in the secretariat and if you stay away you 
won't know what is happening. Apart from that, I do not want to 
be surrounded by officials completely." I reluctantly agreed. At 
Nehru's instance, Secretary- General Girja Shankar Bajpai at the 
External Affairs Department dropped in one evening on his way 
home and talked to me about my appointment in government. He 
said the idea was to designate me as Personal Private Secretary to 
the PM and that all papers for the PM would go through me. He 
added that I would be free to do such non-official work as the PM 
wanted me to. I said I did not want to be integrated into the secre- 
tariat; that my position should remain undefined as I proposed to 



8 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

create my own work in the secretariat eventually. I also laid down a 
condition that my appointment should be conter minus with that of 
the PM. All this was agreed to. He then said that Nehru had told 
him that my emoluments should be fixed only with my consent. He 
asked me what salary I wanted. I replied that I didn't need a salary. 
He said that in government it was not the usual practice to engage 
people without emoluments. I then said I would take Rs 500 per 
month and added that it should be an ad hoc salary, not in any 
grade. He was amused, thought I was a crank, and reported all this 
to Nehru, who asked him not to make much variation upwards in 
the salary I had suggested. So Bajpai had my ad hoc salary fixed at 
Rs 750 per month without any further reference to me. It so hap- 
pened that an official, who was designated as Assistant Private 
Secretary, was drawing almost double my "salary"; but it did not 
bother me because it never entered into my head that a man's 
usefulness was to be measured in terms of the salary he drew. I was 
never asked to undergo a medical examination. Neither was I 
asked to sign the oath of secrecy. 

When the Finance Minister appealed for economy in non-pro- 
ductive governmental expenditure, I stopped drawing my salary 
for a whole year. Soon after that, something which happened an- 
noyed me. The question arose about my travelling by train. The 
administration man in the PM's secretariat told me that I was enti- 
tled only to second class fare. I said I wouldn't travel second class 
and asked him to get me a third class ticket. This was reported to 
the PM. He ascertained that the minimum salary entitling a person 
to travel first class was Rs 1,500 per month and ordered that my 
salary be fixed at that figure as an ad hoc one. Simultaneously, at 
my instance, toy official designation was changed to Special Assis- 
tant to the Prime Minister. At that time no one in government had 
that designation. I cancelled the trip and have never travelled by 
train on government account from that day onwards. 

When N. R. Filial became Cabinet Secretary, the PM asked him 
to keep in touch with me. FilJai sent me the personal files contain- 
ing the efficiency reports of all the members of thelCS and other 
former Secretary- of-State services. He wanted me to read them as 
the background information would be useful to the PM. It took me 
over two months to go through them late at night daily. I was 
impressed by the objective reporting by senior Englishmen on 
their juniors— minus, of course, the political slant. 



Nehru and I 9 

Ever since I started work in the PM's secretariat, no file or paper 
reached the PM except through me — with rare exceptions, in which 
case they would come to me from him. Nothing went out except 
through me. 'This meant matching hours of work with Nehru, and 
sometimes surpassing him. In the PM's house, generally. I ate alone 
in my study while working, sometimes at odd hours. I had come 
to the conclusion that the best way to help the PM was to inform 
his mind. For this I had to study specific issues and problems and 
jet advice from those who were in a position to advise — people in 
government and outside. Except in its broad aspects, I was not 
particularly interested in foreign affairs which, in detail, meant 
international pillow-fighting. In fact, I used to call Krishna Menon 
an "international pillow-fighter." 

After the death of Vallabhbhai Patel, much to my embarrassment 
ministers, MPs and senior officials used to refer to me as "Deputy 
PM," "Power behind the throne" and the like. C. D. Deshmukh, 
in his autobiographical book, chose to refer to me as "the most 
powerful acolyte of the PM." Except for a few, I had only con- 
tempt for ministers who were nothing but a bunch of mediocrities 
or worse. 

It is true that no file or paper containing a recommendation, 
reached the PM without my comments on a slip or a routine note 
if I felt that such comment was called for. Such slips and "routine 
notes" never formed part of the files. They were removed when 
papers came down from the PM. 

One morning, during the 1952 monsoon, I received a telegram 
as I was waiting to go to the office with the PM in his car. The 
telegram announced lh,e death of my father who was eighty-four. 
I put the telegram in my pocket and, without betraying any emo- 
tion, went to office with the PM and did the day's work. No one 
knew about it. In 1950, when I visited my home in Kerala for a 
couple of hours, I had told my brothers and sisters that in case 
anything happened to my parents, they should not expect me to 
come over because, with the then rudimentary air services, there 
was ho chance of my reaching home in time. Four days later, on 
a Sunday, as I returned from the office with the PM for lunch, 
N. K. Seshan handed me another telegram announcing the death of 
my mother who was eighty- one. Seshan had opened the telegram 
and told everyone, including Indira. Foregoing lunch, I went 
straight to bed without changing. In the evening the PM and Indira 



1 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

came down and found me, as usual, in my study, refreshed and 
composed, attending to my work. I told them that my father had died 
four days previously and that my mother fainted immediately. She 
regained consciousness only once for a brief moment. It was rain- 
ing torrentially then. She murmured, "He must be feeling cold" and 
again went into a coma, never to open her eyes again. My parents 
had been married for seventy years. They had their quarrels, suffe- 
rings, sorrows and joys. I have never seen a couple so devoted to 
each other. In fact, they died together. The PM remained silent. 
Indira said, "Papu came to your room after lunch and found you 
fast asleep." In order to break the gloom in my study, I said, "That 
shows that I have a clear conscience," to which Indira retorted, 
to the amusement of her father, "It can also mean that you have 
none" and gave me a smile. I told her, again to the amusement of 
the father, "It is the only witty remark you have ever uttered in 
your life." 

Nehru lost his temper with me only once— for no fauit of mine. 
I was annoyed and I also lost my temper. For two days I sulked. 
Then he sent for me and smiled, which was his way of making up. 
I told him, "I am sorry; I should have shown more understanding. 
Your mind must have been upset about something at that time. I 
have seen you losing your temper many a time, but that has been at 
seeing stupidity or vulgarity." I then told him the story of a famous 
Greek philosopher losing his temper and assaulting the librarian of 
the Public Library in Athens. The reason was that the library did 
not have a copy of a particular book on Socrates. I said I mentally 
approved of it. He smiled. 

It was Nehru's practice right from September 1946 to work in. 
his secretariat on Sundays and holidays. Those were hectic times 
and he hardly got more than five hours of sleep at night. The 
result was that he would doze off at meetings. I wanted him to get 
some sleep in the afternoons of Sundays and holidays. It was no use 
telling him this because he was too proud of his health. So I chose 
to appeal to his sense of fairness. I told him that the PAs and others 
were married people with children and they would like to take 
their wives and children to a cinema or for shopping occasionally. 
I added, "In fairness to them you should stop going to the secreta- 
riat in the afternoons of Sundays and holidays. I shall arrange for 
one or two PAs to be in the house so that you can do your work 
there and, in any event, I will be there. Before agreeing to it he 



Nehru and I j j 

said, "Work never kills anybody." I replied, "Overwork makes a 
person stale. You cannot afford to be stale." As I had expected, 
this led to Nehru taking some rest after lunch on Sundays and 
holidays. I authorized all PAs to take a full day off once a week. 
I had a special allowance sanctioned for them, and for the PAs on 
night duty I arranged, in addition, rent-free quarters near the PM's 
residence. They all worked very hard without looking at their 
watches. Later, the PM got into the habit of having half an hour's 
nap daily after lunch. 

Nehru, recognized as one of the world's five best English prose 
writers of his day, was loath to sign anything drafted by others 
except strictly protocol communications. The result was that he 
had to spend an enormous amount of time in dictating letters and 
drafting or dictating statements and speeches. He has signed more 
communications drafted by me than by all the others put together. 
That was because, when the signed letters and notes came from 
him, I would detain some that were dictated in his weariness late 
at night. These I redrafted for his signature. 

Some of Nehru's finest speeches were either extempore or written 
in his own hand when alone, without any disturbance, and when he 
was emotionally stirred. The "Tryst with Destiny" speech delivered 
at the midnight meeting of the Constituent Assembly on 14-15 
August 1947 was written in his own hand. When the typed copy 
and the handwritten draft were delivered to me by the PA, I con- 
sulted Roget's International Thesaurus and went to Nehru.' I said 
"Date with Destiny" was not a happy phrase for a solemn occasion 
because the word date had acquired an American connotation of 
assignation with girls and women. I suggested its replacement with 
"tryst" or "rendezvous," but cautioned that the phrase "Rendez- 
vous with Destiny" was used by President Franklin Roosevelt in 
one of his famous wartime speeches. He thought for a moment and 
changed date to tryst in the typescript. The original handwritten 
draft with the word date remained with me all these years and was 
handed over recently to the Nehru Museum and Library along with 
innumerable documents and photographs. 

The broadcast on the day of Gandhiji's assassination, with the 
sublime words "the Light has gone out," was made extempore, 
without the aid of any notes . 

At the end of 1951 I wanted S. D. Upadhyaya, who had worked 
for Nehru and his father for long years, and who was rotting, to be 



12 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

put up as a Congress candidate for election to the first Lok Sabha. 
In fact, I had advised Upadhyaya to find a suitable constituency 
and get the Provincial Congress Committee to sponsor him. One 
day, while I was going with the PM to N. N. Bery, the dentist, I 
spoke to him about Upadhyaya, He reacted strongly against the 
proposal. He asked, "What can he do in parliament? He is singular- 
ly unsuitable for parliament." I said, "He will be as good or as bad 
as fifty per cent of the Congress MPs; and it will be a fitting 
reward for a man known for his loyalty though not ability." He 
kept quiet. Nehru was then Congress President. On our way home 
from Dr Bery's clinic he asked me to tell Upadhyaya to have his 
name sent to the AICC by a PCC. I said that this had already been 
done and his proposed constituency was Satna in Vindhya Pradesh. 
That is how Upadhyaya entered parliament and remained a 
member of either House for several terms. If any man deserved a 
prize for never opening his mouth in parliament, it was Upadh- 
yaya. I am glad the poor man, in his old age (he is now past 
seventy-eight), is now entitled to draw a pension of Rs 500 per month 
as an ex-MP. 

Throughout my association with government I never asked for 
any favours from the PM or any minister or any official. I hated to 
be a supplicant before anyone. No relative of mine, near or distant, 
ever got a job or any favour from government. However, I did not 
hesitate to intervene directly sometimes, and mostly through the 
PM, in cases where injustice was done to individuals. It is true that 
I have been instrumental in the appointment of innumerable 
ministers, governors and non-official ambassadors— none of them 
related to me. There was perfect understanding between Nehru and 
me. On some fare occasions he did question my judgment, but he 
doubted nothing else. He treated me as a colleague. Of course, he 
knew that I was not available to be treated in any other way. I have 
also been instrumental in preventing some appointments. One such 
I shall relate. Soon after the appointment of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit 
as an ambassador, Nehru sponsored his brother-in-law, G. P. 
Hutheesing, for appointment as commissioner to Malaya. He had 
gone with Nehru to Malaya as his secretary in January 1946 and 
stayed back for a couple of weeks to study the position of Indians 
there. Two senior officials of the Commonwealth Relations Depart- 
ment saw me privately and requested me to prevent the appoint- 
ment if possible. I decided to resort to the indirect approach. 



Nehru and I 13 

I talked to Hutheesing, who happened to be in Delhi then, and 
told him that it would be infra dig to accept a diplomatic post 
which did not carry the rank of a first class ambassador, consider- 
ing his education and background. I asked him, "Why do you, a 
rich" man, want to lower yourself?" He said, "I am going to 
tell Bhai this evening that I don't want it." Thus Gunotham 
Purushotham Hutheesing was talked out of a situation which 
would have resulted in Nehru being accused of nepotism. Some 
months later, while driving to Palam airport, I related the whole 
story to the PM; and also told him the story about the only son of 
my widowed sister who was old enough to be my mother. She sent 
him to me in Delhi for a job. There was then a vacancy in the PM's 
secretariat for which he was qualified; or I could have easily fixed 
him up elsewhere; but I gave him his train fare and some pocket 
money to return home. My sister was deeply hurt. Nehru told me 
that I was a fool to have done it. I replied that in some matters I 
would rather be a fool. I asked him, "Didn't you recently say that 
in public life one should not only be correct but should appear to 
be so?" Silence was the understandable reaction. 

In the mid-fifties a minister of state foolishly got into trouble. 
He was sent as a delegate to the UN General Assembly. A rich 
man, and a married man with children, he took with him a young- 
ish woman and stayed in hotels in New York, London and Paris, 
entering their names as "Mr and Mrs" in order to stay together in 
the same rooms. Much later the woman arrived at the residence of 
the minister in New Delhi with her baggage and demanded 
the right to stay there even as a servant— much to the embarrass- 
ment of the minister and his wife. She was thrown out; but she 
managed to get a room in Western Court. She met many important 
people and registered her complaint with them. Finally, she way- 
laid the PM as he and I were going home from the office. She 
mumbled something to the PM. While driving home, the PM 
asked me to send for the minister and talk to him. I rang up 
the minister and he came in the afternoon to my office. It was 
a Saturday when parliament was not in session. He confessed to 
everything. I gave him a piece of paper and asked him to write out 
his resignation from the Council of Ministers addressed to the PM. 
As I dictated slowly, he wrote, "I hereby tender my resignation 
from the Council of Ministers for personal reasons. I shall be grate- 
ful if you will be good enough to forward it to the President 



* 4 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

for his acceptance." I asked the minister to see me on Monday 
morning in my office in Parliament House with a common friend, 
U. S. Malliah, MP, who was aware of the incident. They met me 
as suggested. I told the minister that where hormones were con- 
cerned I had no right to pass judgment on anyone; but I added, 
"You have committed the inconceivable folly of entering your 
name and that of the woman in hotel registers everywhere as "Mr 
and Mrs." Some people have egged her on and sent her to Delhi 
to blackmail you. I suggest that you buy her silence. Your good 
friend Malliah, I am sure, will succeed in persuading her to quietly 
go away from Delhi. Malliah should decide the amount to be given 
to her. Malliah decreed that, considering the minister's financial 
position, he should give her Rs 50,000. This was done within two 
days, and the woman left Delhi quietly. Later, I gave the PM all 
the facts and the letter of resignation of the minister. 7 he PM thought 
over the matter for a couple of days and decided not to accept the 
resignation. And the minister survived and prospered. He became a 
Cabinet Minister in the Indira regime during which he proved to be 
the most servile of ministers. He was the first to take the little boy 
Sanjay around in his state, launching him into politics. At a public 
meeting organized at government expense, the minister stood up on 
his haunches and said something very profound, "I have slaved for 
your grandfather and your mother, and I shall slave for you." I do 
not know for whom he is slaving now. 

It was never in my nature to be a sycophant and a flatterer. 
I have irritated and annoyed Nehru in private more than H. V. 
Kamath, Ram Manohar Lohia or Raj Narain in public. Once, 
at a reception at the India House in London, to which Attlee and 
several other dignitaries came, Nehru stood in a corner chatting 
with Lady Mountbatten all the while. Krishna Menon turned to me 
and said that people were commenting on it and requested me to 
break in so that Nehru could move about. I told him that I had no 
locus standi, he was the host and it was his duty to make the PM 
circulate. Krishna Menon did not have the guts to do the right 
thing. Two other similar parties were in the offing elsewhere in the 
next few days, and I did not want a repetition of the PM being 
glued to one person. Later, in the evening I sent the PM a hand- 
written note about the incident which, I said, resulted in unfavour- 
able comment and needless gossip. I did not wish to embarrass him 
by talking to him personally about this matter. He was too big 



Nehru and I 15 

a man to take my note amiss. It had the desired effect and the other 
two parties went off well. In the ultimate analysis, I really did not 
care what Nehru or anyone else thought of me as long as I 
was true to myself. 

After my resignation from government in 1959, I continued 
to do some personal work for Nehru. The last time I saw him was 
on 27 April 1964. 1 gave him a prepared note. He read it twice. He 
could not take in anything. I told him that he need not bother and 
that I would leave written instructions to his staff on his behalf. He 
was no longer in a condition to do any useful work. I felt immeasur- 
ably sad. I went off to Simla with the premonition that I would 
never see him again. On 27 May 1964, in the forenoon, I received 
a telephone message from a friend in Delhi that the PM was sink- 
ing. The Lieutenant-Governor of Himachal Pradesh was good 
enough to arrange transport for me from Simla to Delhi where I 
arrived late at night. It was a hot and dusty day; and in Delhi there 
was an earthquake. 

Though I have found it psychologically difficult to write 
some chapters of this book, it was this chapter that I found the 
most difficult. 



2 Attack On Me by the Communists 



In the winter of 1958 some Communists chose to mount a 
virulent attack on me. I shall not attempt to give the details here. 
They are contained .in my letter of resignation dated 12 January 
1959 to the Prime Minister and a letter dated 11 January 1959 to 
the Prime Minister from Rajkuniari Amrit Kaur, included in full 
as Appendix 3. 

The Prime Minister did not want to accept my resignation and 
told me so. But I had made up my mind that, for all the world* 
I would not continue in a position where I could not defend my- 
self- My resignation letter was not written in a huff. Once written 
it was never to be withdrawn. The Prime Minister kept my letter 
of resignation pending for six days. On 18 January 1959 I sent a 
note to the Prime Minister conveying my decision to stop work 
after two days and to move out of the Prime Minister's house. 
That night he sent me a handwritten letter reluctantly agreeing to 
my request In fact, I gave him no choice in the matter. 

At 4 a.m. on 27 January, which happened to be my birthday, 
I woke up to get ready to leave by car for Almora with my dear 
friend Boshi Sen, the agricultural scientist. At 4.45 a.m. Nehru 
came down to my room and sat down with Boshi Sen. He knew 
that it was my birthday; but he did not want to say "happy birth- 
day" because there was nothing happy on that day either for me 
or for him. As I was leaving, he embraced me and told Dr Sen, 
"Boshi, look after him." 

I was to learn later, with a considerable measure of happiness, 
that the servants and malis (gardeners) at the PM's house spontane- 
ously went in a procession to the PM, the day after I left, to request 
him to ensure that I returned to the PM's house. 

At his press conference on 7 February 1959, the PM said, 
"My broad appreciation of Mr Mathai was of efficiency, integrity 



Attack On Me by the Communists 17 

and loyalty, at any rate loyalty to me; but also a person who. 
acted foolishly often in small matters; and sometimes rather threw 
his weight about. But I never doubted his integrity and I have had 
no reasons since than. . . connected as he was with me, a delicate 
position, which could have been misused very easily; all this time 
I have no reason, not the slightest reason, that financially speaking 
it was in the slightest degree misused." 

On 16 February Lady Mouhtbatten came to see me at the 
residence of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. She was exercised over the 
possibility of my having turned bitter as a result of the one or 
two unfavourable remarks the PM had made at the press conference 
She asked me if the PM had ever pulled me up for the matters he 
had mentioned. I said no. She commented, "Then he had no right 
to make those remarks in public." r told her that he must himself 
have been upset about my leaving him and the words might have 
escaped his lips unintentionally. I assured her that I was not 
particularly hurt by them. Then I handed over to her a copy 
of my lengthy reply to a Cabinet Minister who had written to me 
disapproving of the PM's remarks about me at the press conference 
She took it with her to read. She mentioned to me that the PM 
had told her that soon after the press conference Secretary. 
General N.R. Pillai of the External Affairs Ministry wrote 
a private note to him on behalf of himself and the three Secretaries 
of the ministry to say that at no time had I thrown my weight 
about m so far as they were concerned, and further that I was 
always helpful to them. She made it known to me that the PM was 
distressed at having made those remarks. I asked her to tell him 
to forget about the whole matter. She came the next day to tell 

r^f vUT* t0 the Cabfnet Minister S reatl y move d her and 
that the PM shed tears when he read it in her presence. 

bJT f- 1 W - Sm Alm ° ra J received a c °nmmnication *om the 
PM that m view of the sustained noises by some opposition MPs 

m parhament he, in consultation with his colleagues, had decided 

to ask the Cabmet Secretary to ascertain the facts from me and 

submit a report to him. The PM advised me to come down to 

Delhi. So I came and stayed in Rajkumari Amrit Kaur's house. 

On return to Delhi, I informed the PM that I would gladly 

cooperate with the Cabinet Secretary provided three conditions 

were met. I told him that I did not like any one-man business in a 



18 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

matter like this— in so far as the Cabinet Secretary and he himself 
were concerned. My conditions were: 

1) The Chairman of the Central Board of Revenue should be 
associated with the Cabinet Secretary in the process of ascertaining 
the facts. 

2) The Cabinet Secretary's report should be examined and 
commented upon by the Finance Minister. 

3) An authority independent of the government should pro- 
nounce an opinion on the findings of the Cabinet Secretary. I 
suggested the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India should 
undertake this task. 

The PM consulted his principal colleagues and informed me 
that my conditions met with their wholehearted approval. Parlia- 
ment was informed of this. 

To provide facts and explanations about personal finances 
spread over a period of thirteen years was not an easy matter. 
However, I was able to collect the material and let the Cabinet 
Secretary and his colleague have it before the end of April 1959. 

The following documents, which were placed before both the 
Houses of parliament on 6 May 1959, are given in full in Appen- 
dix 4: 

1) PM's letter to Chairman/Speaker dated 6 May 1959. 

2) PM's note dated 6 May 1959. 

3) Finance Minister's comments dated 6 May 1959. 

4) Comptroller and Auditor-General's comments dated 6 May 
1959. 

Notable Editor S. Mulgaokar wrote a brief editorial in the 
Hindustan Times of 8 May 1959, which I quote on the next page:

"20 Reminiscences ofihe Nehru Age 

The Prime Minister's seniormost colleague, Govind Ballabh 
Pant, asked me if I would return to the Prime Minister's house 
and office. I replied in one sentence, "Only a dog returns to its 
vomit." He promptly reported this to the Prime Minister. Later, 
the Prime Minister asked me if I would like to take up any posi- 
tion in government in India or abroad. I said, "Not any office of 
profit under the government." 

Some time after the noise had died down, a friend asked me, 
"Did that second-rate politician who indulged in wild allegations 
against you day in and day out, with a hot potato stuck in his 
throat, show a modicum of decency by expressing his regret to you 
at least privately?." In reply I could only quote to him an old 
proverb: "Cleanliness in a crow; honesty in a gambler; mildness in 
a serpent; women satisfied with love; vigour in a eunuch; truth in 
a drunkard; friendship in a king; decency in a second-rate politician 
—whoever heard of these things?" 



Personal Embarrassment of a Rebel 



At the Viceroy House at U a.m., on 2 September 1946, on the 
installation of the interim government, an acute personal embarras- 
sment awaited Nehru. He had to affirm allegiance to King George 
VI, Emperor of India and also to affirm that he would well and 
truly serve "our Sovereign." Nehru was suddenly confronted with 
these. He had no choice. He suppressed his embarrassment and 
extreme annoyance and went through the affirmation of allegiance 
and affirmation of office which read as follows: 

Form of Affirmation of Allegiance 
I, Jawaharlal Nehru, do solemnly affirm that I will be faithful 
and bear true allegiance to His Majesty, KING GEORGE THE 
SIXTH, Emperor of India, His Heirs,and Successors, according 
to law. 

Form of Affirmation of Office 
I, Jawaharlal Nehru, do solemnly affirm that I will well and 
truly serve our Sovereign, KING GEORGE THE SIXTH, 
Emperor of India, in the Office of Member of the Governor 
General's Executive Council, and that I will do right to all manner 
of people after the laws and usages of India without fear or 
favour affection or ill-will. 

For several days Nehru went on murmuring like a child, "I had 
not bargained for these." The conscience of Sardar Pate!, Rajendra 
Prasad, Rajaji and others was not pricked. 

When dominion government came on 15 August 1947 the 
Emperor of India automatically stepped down to become King of 
India; and Nehru, the Prime Minister, corresponded directly with 
the King. The British Government went out of the picture. Nehru 



22 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

soon discovered that his communications to the King had to be in 
third person and in the form of "humble duty submissions." When 
the first such submission was placed before him for his signature, 
Nehru was annoyed and said, "Oh Lord" and pushed away the 
signature pad. After some time he signed "the wretched thing." 
Here is a later sample of the humble duty submission: ■

4 Obscurantists to the Fore 



In the Constituent Assembly, which met in New Delhi on 9 Decem- 
ber 1946 and concluded its deliberations on 26 November 1949, a 
demand was spearheaded by Rajendra Prasad and some other obscu- 
rantists that the name of the country should be Bharat and not India 
in the Constitution. Nehru pointed out that in such a case, interna- 
tionally India would loss all the benefits of a "succession state'* such 
as original membership of the United Nations and various interna- 
tional bodies, and all the embassy buildings abroad and so forth. 
Pakistan was a new state seceding from India and had to negotiate 
for membership of international bodies. Nehru told Rajendra Prasad 
and others, "I do not want to put India in an absurd position inter- 
nationally." He also told them that their suggestion would please 
Pakistan most. Rajendra Prasad and others hummed and hawed; 
but Nehru stood firm. Finally, he said he had no objection to 
mention somewhere in the Constitution "India that is Bharat." When 
Rajendra Prasad became President of the Republic, he ordered 
that the armbands of his ADCs should contain the word Bharat 
and not India. This practice continues. 

Nehru had to give into the same set of people and agree to the 
inclusion of cow protection and prohibition in the Constitution. 
Left to himself, Nehru would not have cluttered the Constitution 
with all these. His emphasis was on the "right to work"; but 
obscurantists wanted to go backwards. 

There was even a feeble demand for the protection of monkeys, 
descendants of the mythical Hanuman. 

Soon after Rajendra Prasad became President of the Republic, 
on 26 January 1950, he released a number of hefty brown monkeys 
into the President's Estate. One day a few of them came to the 
Prime Minister's office in the secretariat through a door to the 
balcony which was kept open. I happened to be in the room wit n

Nehru and chased them away. One ran away with a paperweight. 
I told Nehru, "This is the handiwork of Rajendra Babu." He 
laughed. The monkey population was augmented by a substantial 
number released at the Birla temple. They still come up to the 
President's Estate where the monkey menace is very real; they take 
away vegetables and fruits and also attack helpless women and 
children even today. 

A Victim of Obscurantism and Barbarous Intolerance— 

B. R, Ambedkar 

Through a friend of mine, P. K. Panikkar, who was a Sanskrit 
scholar and deeply religious, B. R Ambedkar became interested in 
me. I had told Panikkar about my admiration for Ambedkar, but 
added that he just fell short of being a great man by inches because 
he could not wholly rise above bitterness. However, I said that no 
one had any right to blame him, having regard to the humiliations 
and indignities he had to suffer throughout his life. Panikkar, who 
was a frequent visitor to Ambedkar, obviously reported all this to 
him. On a Sunday morning Ambedkar rang me up and asked me 
to tea that evening. He said he. had asked Panikkar also. I turned 
up at the appointed time. 

After some pleasantries, Ambedkar told me good-humouredly, 
"So you have found fault with me; but I am prepared to accept 
your criticism." Then he talked about untouchability. He said that 
the railways and factories had done more to combat untouchability 
than Gandhi's personal campaigns. He" asserted that the real 
problem of the untouchables was economic and not "temple entry," 
as advocated by Gandhi. 

Ambedkar said, "Our Constitution will, no doubt, abolish 
untouchability on paper; but it will remain in India as a virus 
for at least a hundred years. It is deeply embedded in the minds 
of people." He recalled the abolition of slavery in the United 
States and said, "The improvement of the condition of the Negroes 
is slow even after 150 years." I said I couldn't agree with him more 
and told him the story of my mother. Despite almost 2,000 years of 
Christianity behind her, she practised untouchability with as much 
conviction as Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. She would not allow 
a Harijan to draw water from our well in summer when water was 



Obscurantists to the Fore 25 

generally scarce. She would rush for a bath if an untouchable 
came within twenty feet of her. 

Then Ambedkar said with pride, "The Hindus wanted the Vedc.s, 
and they sent for Vyasa who was not a caste Hindu. The Hindus 
wanted an epic, and they sent for Valmiki who was an untouchable. 
The Hindus want a Constitution, and they have sent for me." He 
said, "The greatest tragedy of the Hindi belt in India is that the 
people of the region discarded Valmiki and installed Tulsidas." He 
expressed the view that the people of this vast region will remain 
backward and obscurantist until they replace Tulsidas by Valmiki. 
He reminded me that, according to the Valmiki Ramayana, "when 
Rama and Lakshmana arrived at the ashrama of Bharadwaja, the 
sage assembled a few fattened calves for Rama to choose from to be 
salaughtered for the feast. So Rama and his entourage were fed on 
veal; Tulsidas cut out ail this." I told him that Vatsyayana, in his 
Kama Sutra, has prescribed that young couples should be fed on 
veal for six months before marriage. 

Ambedkar pointed his finger at me and said, "You Malayalis 
have done the greatest harm to this country." 1 was taken aback 
and asked him how. He said, "You sent that man Shankaracharya, 
a dessicated expert at logic, on a padayatra (walking tour) to the 
north to drive away Buddhism from this country." Ambedkar added 
that the Buddha was the greatest soul India had ever produced. He 
also said that the greatest man India produced in recent centuries 
was not Gandhi but Swami Vivekananda. 

I reminded Ambedkar that "it was Gandhi who suggested to 
Nehru to invite you to join the government." This was news to him. 
I amended my statement by saying that the idea struck Gandhi and 
Nehru simultaneously. It was Ambedkar who piloted the Consti- 
tution Bill in the Constituent Assembly. 

Ambedkar confided in me that he had decided to become a 
Buddhist and to advise his followers to do likewise. 

Until he left Delhi, Ambedkar kept in touch with me. He was a 
remarkable man who richly deserves the salute of the Indian people. 



5 Mahatma Gandhi 



Even though I had opportunities of developing contacts with 
Gandhiji, I instinctively kept away from him. Of course, I recognized 
his greatness. But I was baffled by him. My contacts with him were 
limited to personally delivering to him important communications 
from Nehru. 

Early in 1947 an old foreign friend presented to me a very small, 
elegant, ivory-coloured transistor radio— one of the earliest of its 
kind. As soon as it was switched on, it started working. On closing 
the lid, it stopped. Nehru saw it and was fascinated like a child. So 
I gave it to him. He kept it in his dressing room and listened to the 
radio news bulletin while shaving. He used to bring it down at all 
mealtimes to listen to. He spoke to Gandhiji about it and also 
about me. Gandhiji had already heard about me from Rajkumari 
Amrit Kaur. Nehru told me that Gandhiji had never listened to a 
radio and asked me to take the radio with me to Birla House (where 
Gandhiji was staying) and let him listen to the 6 p.m. news bulletin. 
I reached Birla House a few minutes before 6 p.m. and presented 
myself before Gandhiji. He asked me to sit down on the floor in 
front of him, which I did. At 6 p.m. I switched the radio on. 
Gandhiji listened for about a minute and said, "Close it, does any- 
one speak sense nowadays?" It was a period of serious communal 
troubles in India. 

Gandhiji baffled me on several matters: 

1) Preaching Ram Rajya of Hindu mythology. Millions of Mus- 
lims and other minorities had no use for Rama Rajya. They 
became alienated by Gandhiji's continued preaching of Rama Rajya. 

2) Preaching of cow worship and incessant writing about it in 
the Harijan. Apart from Muslims and other minorities, as well as 
some sections of Harijans and tribal people and adivasis, who were 
alienated by this, millions of educated Hindus wanted to worship 



Mahatma Gandhi 27 

nothing or at least something better than a cow. 

3) Preaching of celibacy for married couples. Few except Morarji 
Desai and some others were converted to this. Some, who practised 
it, eventually gave up; and some developed psychological prob- 
lems. 

4) Advocating, support for the Khilafat movement in India. 
This was one of the most opportunistic adventures of Gandhiji's. 
When Kemal Ataturk came up and abolished the Caliphate, 
Gandhiji looked foolish. Gandhiji was trying to forge Hindu- 
Muslim unity on quicksand. 

5) Gandhiji's unscientific and staggering remark early in 1934, 
to the effect that the Bihar earthquake had been a punishment for 
the sin of untouchability. 

6) Fierce condemnation of smoking by the workers of the textile 
industry in Lancashire thrown out of employment owing to the 
boycott of British cloth in India. 

7) Savage treatment of a Congress worker who could not give 
full account of a small amount placed at his disposal . Gandhiji asked 
him to walk over a hundred miles during the height of summer to 
get back to his village, even though he was personally convinced 
that the man was honest and innocent. C.F.Andrews, who wit- 
nessed this harsh treatment, took the man aside and gave him his 
train fare and a few rupees from his pocket without Gandhiji's 
knowledge. 

8) Fanatic advocacy of Hindi, one of the least developed langu- 
ages of India, surpassing that of any chauvinist in the Hindi belt. 

9) Giving the world, in a % quixotic gesture, his ideal nominee 
for the office of Head of State in India—an untouchable girl "of 
stout heart, incorruptible and crystal-like in her purity." However, 
at the appropriate time, he advised Lord Mountbatten to accept 
the invitation of the Congress to become the first Governor-Gene- 
ral of independent India. He also advised Mountbatten to move 
out of Viceroy House and live in a simple home without servants. 
He wanted Viceroy House to be converted into a hospital. He did 
not fail to give further advice to Mountbatten to grow his own 
vegetables and clean his own toilet! 

10) Gandhiji's letter to Viceroy Lord Linlithgow, written early 
in June 1940, as Hitler had just overrun Holland, and Belgium was 
about to fall. The letter read, "This manslaughter must be stopped. 
You are losing. If you persist, it will result in greater bloodshed. 



28 • Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Hitler is not a bad man. If you will call it off today, he will 
follow suit. If you want to send me to Germany or anywhere else, 
I am at your disposal. You can also inform the Cabinet about 
this." 

There is no record of the Viceroy having forwarded to the 
British Cabinet Gandhiji's "momentous" letter, nor of the sensation 
it created at 10 Downing Street! 

11) Gandhian economics— it is a sure way of achieving eternal 
backwardness and perpetuating poverty in India. Gandhiji had been 
advocating decontrol of foodgrains and other essential items of 
daily use, and the scrapping of rationing soon after the Government 
of India passed into Indian hands, even though the food situation 
was very critical. At the instance of Nehru, John Matthai called on 
Gandhiji and talked to him for an hour. Matthai reported that 
throughout the one hour he had the definite impression that he 
was addressing a wall. The matter came up before the Cabinet 
which was equally divided. The decision in favour of Gandhiji's 
demand was taken by the Prime Minister's casting vote. It had dis- 
astrous consequences; and the country and its people had to pay a 
very heavy price for adopting Gandhian economic. Sarojini Naidu 
once said, -Many will never know how much it cost to keep that 
old man in poverty." 

12) During one of his fasts Gandhiji said, "If I have acetone in 
my urine, it is because my faith in Rama is incomplete!" 

13) Gandhiji's advice to women faced with rape in the Punjab 
during partition was to bite their tongue and hold their breath until 
they died. Confucius gave different advice to a young girl. He told 
her, "If you find yourself in a situation where rape is inevitable 
and there h no chance of escape, my advice to you is to lie back 
and enjoy it." 

14) Gandhiji's rejection of modern birth control methods to 
curb population. What was acceptable to him was the one he 
himself practised-continence. He refused to make allowance for 
human frailty. 

I never considered Gandhiji had anything to teach me about 
nonviolence, ends and means, detachment (nishkama karma), com- 
passion and loving one's enemies, because these were preached 
and practised far more eloquently about 2,000 years ago by Jesus 
Christ. G.K. Chesterton once said, "Christianity has not been 
tried and found wanting; it had been found difficult and never 



Mahatma Gandhi 2 9 

tried" On a smaller scale, this is how I felt about Gandhiji. J 
could never have been a follower of Gandhiji *s however much I 
tried. In fact I did not want to try. 

While Gandhiji's opposition to the partition of India was 
heroic, he was unrealistic considering the past, including some 
actions of his own, that contributed to it. No wonder the Congress 
Working Committee passed a resolution absolving him of respon- 
sibility for the decision agreeing to partition. 

The last phase of Gandhiji's life constituted his finest hour 
more especially the last month of his earthly existence (January 
1948). He was exercised over two matters: 

1) For weeks, representatives of Muslims had been asking him 
for advice as to whether they should risk death or give up the 
struggle and migrate to Pakistan, Gandhiji's advice was, "Stay and 
risk death rather than run away." Delhi and surrounding areas 
were overflowing with Hindu and Sikh refugees crying for vengeance 
on all Muslims staying in India. They had seized mosques and 
Muslim homes all over the city and surrounding areas. Gandhiji 
wanted them to return those homes to their Muslim owners and 
go back to their camps. 

2) The Indian Cabinet decided to withhold payment of the 
partition debt of Rs 550 million to Pakistan. The Cabinet did not 
want to disturb the already disturbed public opinion by giving 
Pakistan the money which was likely to be used to pay for arms 
which would be used against India in conditions existing at that 
time. Lord Mountbatten feared that the decision to withhold 
payment might drive a desperate and bankrupt Jinnah to war. The 
Cabinet refused to listen to Mountbatten. Gandhiji considered the 
Cabinet decision as immoral. 

On these two issues Gandhiji's last fast (13 to 18 January 1948) 
took place, Sardar Patel tried to argue with Gandhiji about the 
paymeht of Rs 550 million to Pakistan. Gandhiji's only reply was, 
"You are not the man I once knew." (Gandhiji was deeply dis- 
tressed at two speeches Patel delivered during the previous two 
months at public meetings in Lucknow and Jaipur severely critici- 
zing him.) Within three days of Gandhiji's fast the Government of 
India announced that it had ordered immediate payment of the 
amount to Pakistan. 

On the 18th, representatives of militant Sikhs, Muslims, Chris- 
tians, Parsis, Harijans, Sadhus, Hindu Mahasabha and RSS stood 






3° Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

by GandhijVs beside and gave the undertaking to preserve com- 
munal peace not only in Delhi but also throughout India. The High 
Commissioner of Pakistan was also present. 

Gandhiji could be devastating in his comments about people. 
One of his undated letters to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who gave it 
to me as a present, read: 

You have asked my opinion about Govind Das after having 
done the mischief. I have bitter experiences about him. He is 
ambitious, vain, vulgar, crooked and unreliable. His ventures 
have resulted in losses. This is the opinion of those who have had 
dealings with him. I know him well He used to be like a son to 
me. I used to think well of him. But I soon discovered that he 
was a schemer. Now he rarely comes near me. I am sorry, but 
such is my experience. 1 hope you haven't dropped much. 

Nehru once expressed the view that Gandhiji's approach to 
events was feminine, that is, intuitive, and was more of a reaction 
than the result of logical reasoning. An extract from Nehru's letter 
dated 3 June 1942, addressed to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur reads: 

I was glad to see Bapu and have a talk with him. This cleared 
up some matters, but I should like to see much more of him and 
find out exactly what is in his mind. I find his approach to 
events is rather feminine, if I may say so. That is to say it is 
intuitive and is more of a reaction than the result of logical 
reasoning. Much can be said for this, but it is a risky business 
sometimes. 

As everyone knows, Nehru was the draftsman of the Congress 
regardless of who was its President. Practically all its resolutions 
and correspondence with British authorities were drafted by him. 
Below is a letter to Lord Pethick Lawrence dated 6 May 1946, 
drafted by Nehru and corrected by Gandhiji, for Congress Presi- 
dent Maulana Azad to sign: 

My colleagues and I followed with care the proceedings of the 
conference yesterday and tried to understand what our conver- 
sations were leading us to. I confess to feeling somewhat mysti- 
fied and disturbed at the vagueness of our talks and some of

the assumptions underlying them. While we would like to asso- 
ciate ourselves with every effort to explore ways and means of 
finding a bajis for agreement, we must not deceive ourselves, the 
Cabinet Mission or the representatives of the Muslim League 
into the belief that the way the Conference has so far pro- 
ceeded furnishes hope of success. Our general approach to the 
questions before us was stated briefly in my letter to you of 
April 28. We find that this approach has been largely ignored 
and a contrary method has been followed. We realise that some 
assumptions have to be made in the early stages as otherwise 
there can be no progress. But assumptions which ignore or run 
contrary to fundamental issues are likely to lead to misunder- 
standings during the later stages. 

In my letter of April 28, I stated that the basic issue before 
us was that of Indian independence and the consequent with- 
drawal of the British army from India, for there can be no 
independence so long as there is a foreign army on Indian soil. 
We stand for the independence of the whole of India now and 
not in the distant or near future. Other matters are subsidiary 
to this and can be fully discussed and decided by the Constituent 
Assembly. 

At the Conference yesterday I rerTerred to this again and we 
were glad to find that you and your colleagues, as well as the 
other members of the conference, accepted Independence as the 
basis of our talks. It was stated by you that the Constituent 
Assembly would finally decide about the nexus or other relation- 
ship that might be established between a free India and England. 
While this is perfectly true, it does not affect the position now, 
and that is the acceptance of Indian independence now. 

If that is so, then certain consequences inevitably follow. 
We felt yesterday that there was no appreciation of these con- 
sequences. A Constituent Assembly is not going to decide the 
question of independence; that question must be and, we take 
it, has been decided now. That Assembly will represent the will 
of the free Indian nation and give effect to it. It is not going to 
be bound by any previous arrangements. It has to be preceded 
by a Provisional Government, which must function, as far as 
possible, as a Government of free India, and which should under- 
take to make all arrangements for the the transitional period.

34 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

In our discussions yesterday repeated references were made 
to 'groups' of provincesjunctioning together, and it was even 
suggested that such^group would have an executive and legis- 
lative machinery. This method of grouping has not so far been 
discussed by us but still our talks seemed to presume all this. I 
should like to make it very clear that we are entirely opposed to 
any executive or legislative machinery for a group of provinces 
or units of the Federation. That will mean a sub-federation, if 
not something more, and we have already told you that we do not 
accept this. It would result in creating three layers of executive 
and legislative bodies, an arrangement which will be cumbrous, 
static and disjointed, leading to continuous friction. We are not 
aware of any such arrangement in any country. 

We are emphatically of opinion that it is not open to the 
Conference to entertain any suggestions for a division of India. If 
that is to come, it should come through the Constituent Assembly 
free of any influence of the present Paramount Power. 

Another point we wish to make clear is that we do not accept 
the proposal for parity as between groups in regard to the exe- 
cutive or the legislature. We realise that everything possible 
should be done to remove fears and suspicions from the mind 
of every group and community. But the way to do this is not by 
unreal methods which go against the basic principles of demo- 
cracy on which we hope to build up our constitution. 

Below is the draft of a letter from Nehru dated 12 June 1946, 
addressed to Viceroy Lord Wavell as corrected by Gandhiji: 

I am sorry for the slight delay in answering your letter of today's 
date. Your invitation to me to see you today at 5 p.m. in order 
to confer with you and Mr. Jinnah about the Interim Govern- 
ment placed me in a somewhat difficult position. I would gladly 
meet you at any time, but our official spokesman in regard to 
such matters is naturally our President, Maulana Azad. He can 
speak and confer authoritatively, which I cannot do. It is there- 
fore proper that he should be in charge on our behalf of any 
authoritative conversations that might take place. But since you 
have asked me to come I shall do so. I hope however that you 
will appreciate my position and that I can only talk without

authority, which vests in our President and the Working Com- 
mittee. 

Many people believe that it was Nehru who first referred to- 
Gandhiji as "Father of the Nation." It is incorrect. It was Safojini 
Naidu who did. When Gandhiji briskly walked to the rostrum 
of the Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi (28 March to 2 
April 1947), Sarojini Naidu, who presided over the conference, 
announced in her commanding voice, "the Father of the Nation.'* 
There was an anticlimax to this— uncharitable people began to call 
Gandhiji's son Devadas Gandhi, "the Nation." 

It was again Sarojini Naidu who, in another context, called 
Gandhiji "the Micky Mouse." 

I have pondered over the figure of the three monkeys Gandhiji 
kept in front of him. "Speak no evil" is noble but "see no evil" 
and "hear no evil" appeared to me as ill-considered and unprofit- 
able propositions. Imagine a situation in the Rajya Sabha where the 
Chairman, all the MPs, and the pressmen in the gallery have closed 
their ears, and Bhupesh Gupta alone is available to speak. It will 
be a tragedy. The audience will miss the most pleasant voice and 
the public will miss the daily quota of his inimitable pearls of 
wisdom the next morning. 

Throughout his life Nehru had what might be called a "father 
complex." This was very pronounced in his attitude and approach 
to Gandhiji. Nehru opened his heart almost completely to Gandhiji 
and discussed with him practically everything. After Gandhiji's 
death, Nehru had no one to whom he could open his heart. Con- 
sequently he got compartmentalized. He discussed several matters 
with Sardar Patel and Rajaji, some with Maulana Azad, Govind 
Ballabh Pant, Radhakrishnan and Gopalaswami Ayyangar. They 
were all men older than him. As Prime Minister, Nehru never 
summoned them; whenever he had something to discuss with them, 
he would go to their houses. 

Death by assassination claimed Gandhiji at 5.17 p.m. on Friday, 
30 January 1948. , Some found it a parallel to the crucifixion of 
Jesus Christ and called it the second crucifixion. Immediately after 
the assassination, the telephone rang at 17 York Road. I took it. 
The call was from Biria House announcing Gandhiji's assassina- 
tion. The caller thought that Nehru would be at home at that time; 
but he was still in his office at the Commonwealth Relations

About six months after the assassination I quietly opened the 
door of the Prime Minister's office in the secretariat and found 
Nehru with head bowed and weeping, tears rolling down his cheeks. 
I quietly withdrew and closed the door without Nehru noticing me. 
I knew he was weeping for his beloved Bapu.

In 1972 1 received a letter from Lord Mountbatten requesting me to 
see Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre. I knew that Mountbatten 
had given the two writers recorded interviews for thirty hours. 
Subsequently Larry Collins saw me twice. During these meetings 
Collins pointedly asked me about some matters Mountbatten had 
revealed to him. I mildly contradicted Mountbatten on two or three 
counts. It appears that Collins reported these to Mountbatten at 
about the time the book Freedom at Midnight was published. And 
Mountbatten went on the BBC. The text of his interview was publi- 
shed in the Listener, 30 October 1975. As many in India may not 
have seen the Listener, I quote below the relevant extracts: 

I went to Simla for the simple reason that after the Punjab 
Boundary Force had been divided, which was at the end of August, 
the beginning of September, I had nothing more to do. I was 
only the constitutional head, I wanted to go away from Delia' to 
show the country that their government was in sole power in 
Delhi, and I was just the man to countersign their orders. Then 
after two or three days, my old friend V.P. Menon, the best of 
my Indian staff, rang me up and said: 'The troubles are spreading 
to Delhi, the capital is at risk, you must come back at once', 
I said: 'Who says so?' He said: 'The Prime Minister and the 
Deputy Prime Minister'. 'Well', I said, 'I am not coming'. 'Why 
not?' I said: 'I have come here expressly to show to the world that 
they are in charge of their own country; I don't want to come 
and appear to be breathing down their necks. I will come later 
on'. He said: 'Oh, then, don't bother. If you can't come within 
24 hours, don't bother to come at all. It is all over; we shall 
have lost India'. I finally said: «VP, you are an old swine, you 
have persuaded me'. 



Lord Mountbatten and "Freedom at Midnight" 41 

I came down at once. I went straight round to Government 
House, and there were the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime 
Minister waiting for me. They told me how serious the situation 
-was, and they said; 'Will you take over the country?' I said: 
*How can I? You have just taken over'. 'Yes, but we are versed 
in the arts of agitation, not administration. We can't do it by 
ourselves. You must come back'. I saw they were serious. I said: 
*Well, I will help you on one condition, that we find a way of 
disguising the fact that it is I who am running India. We must 
make it appear that it is you. And we must keep this a secret, 
certainly in our lifetimes, for your own good and reputation'. 

I said: 'We will form an emergency committee. I will choose 
the people to put on it, and the first meeting will take place at five 
o* clock. Call the meeting at once. I will have my own Confe- 
rence Secretary in British style who will take the minutes, we will 
move very very quickly. I want the Prime Minister on my right, 
the Deputy Prime Minister on my left. I will consult you and say: 
'Don't you think we ought to do this?' and you will say 'Yes'. 
And I will say: 'But don't you think we ought to do this?' and 
you say 'Yes'. 

I have had some recent correspondence with Mountbatten on the 
subject. I shall, for the present, leave the book and take on 
Mountbatten. 

I am afraid strict veracity was never one of V.P. Menon's virtues. 
He rang up Mountbatten in Simla at night on 4 September 1947 
on his own, without consulting either the Prime Minister or 
Sardar Patel. Early next morning he rushed to me and made an 
earnest request that I square up the Prime Minister. I asked him if 
there was going to be a naval battle on the Jamuna at Okhla. I advi- 
sed him to appraise Sardar Patel about the whole matter immediate 
ely. Later, I mentioned the matter to the Prime Minister who, as I 
expected, was furious and said he wanted to speak to Menon imme- 
diately on the telephone. As I knew that Menon was one of Nehru's 
earliest antipathies in government, I told the Prime Minister that 
Sardar Patel would be speaking to him on the subject. Nehru was 
impatient and went straight to Sardar Patel's house. Fortunately, 
Menon hadJeft the place by then. On his return from Sardar Patel's 
house, the Prime Minister told me that Sardar Patel was much 
annoyed with Menon; and that now the only thing left to do was 



42 , Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

not to embarrass Mountbatten and do something gracious to asso- 
ciate him with the handling of the developing situation in Delhi 
which Menon had exaggerated enormously. 

In his letter to me dated 14 September 1976 Mountbatten has 
questioned my statement that V.P. Menon had exaggerated the situ- 
ation enormously. "If you cannot come within 24 hours, don't 
bother to come at all. It is all over. We shall have lost India." 
If these words of Menon to Mountbatten on the telephone, on 4 
September 1947 are not an exaggeration, then I do not know the 
meaning of exaggeration. To me these are the words of a hysterical 
woman. I have informed Mountbatten accordingly. 

Mountbatten has admitted in his letter of 14 September 1976to me 
"there is little doubt therefore that though V.P. Menon misled me 
into believing that both the PM and his deputy wished me to return 
to Delhi, he had in fact consulted neither and they were only told 
of his action after I had agreed to return from Simla. I also believe 
that this accounts for the fact that when Nehru and Patel came to 
see me immediately after my return, they appeared to be very ill at 
ease" 

Mountbatten has also admitted to me that as early as 1969 he 
definitely knew of V.P Menon misleading him. And yet in his BBC 
interview in October 1975 he gave his listeners the definite imp- 
ression that he returned from Simla at the request of Nehru and 
Patel. This, to say the least, is lacking in candour. 

I was not present at Mountbatten's meeting witt Nehru and 
Patel soon after his return from Simla. Mountbatten's account of 
what transpired at the meeting provides amusing reading and is in 
keeping with Mountbatten's high sense of drama. Nehru is repor- 
ted to have told Mountbatten, "You have commanded millions of 
men." Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Supreme Command was the 
most neglected command of the second world war. I do not know 
where and when he commanded "millions of men," The Indian 
army within the borders of India was not under nis command. 
The Americans were indifferent to Mountbatten. In fact they used 
to call it the Jackal Command because the task of bringing Japan 
to book was assigned to General Douglas MacArthur. The Ameri- 
can interest in Southeast Asia was confined largely to supplying 
essential war material over the hump by air and heavy stuff 
by lorries to China by the India-Burma-China Road that they had 
constructed, maintained and protected along difficult terrain.

Monsieur Geoff roy de Courcel while he was still the French 
Ambassador here asked me to luncheon at his Embassy to meet 
Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, who formerly served on the 
SHAPE staff together and on leaving their respective .armies went 
into the most astonishing literary partnership. 

I enclose a 'blurb* about them produced by their publishers 
whleh wili show you that they- have said millions of copies of their 
historical books. 

The object of the Ambassador inviting roe to lunch was to persuade 
me to help them over the book that they have decided to do about the 
Transfer of Power In India. 

They arc now planning to visit India in the middle of January for 
about a month and I would be most grateful If you would allow 'them io 
call on you at some mutually convenient time. If you will kindly let 
me know whether this la agreeable to you, I will arrange for tbem to 
make direct contact with you. 

It is a tragedy that Pandit jl is no longer alive to see them but I 
have told them that no living person knows more about him, particularly 
during those vital years 1947 and 1948 than you. X would be really 
grateful for any help you can give them. 

You scom to be doing a great job with the Edwlna Mounthatten Trust 
In India. How thrilled she would have been with all that you are doing 
In her memory. We are all most grateful. 

With best wishes to you for 1973.

44 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

The Americans were averse to helping imperialist countries like 
Britain, Holland and France, to re-establish their colonial domi- 
nation over the vast areas of Southeast Asia. Nehru is also repor- 
ted to have told Mountbatten, "You are a high-level administra- 
tor." I have always felt that there is some truth in Lenin's saying, 
"Even a cook can administer a state." 

I never thought that Delhi and the bifurcated Punjab constitu- 
ted the whole of India "to betaken over" by Mountbatten. Neither 
do I thmk that a constitutional Governor-General chairing a com- 
mittee to deal with non-controversial matters amounts to "taking 
over the country." The Governor-General is at once a part of the 
government and above it. The reputation of Nehru and Patel was 
not involved. 

If I am asked whether Mountbatten would have been invited 
formally to help in the crisis, but for the situation created by V P 
Menon, my answer is no. After ail, Pakistan, which was in a worse 
position, without even a capital of its own, managed to survive 

What happened in Punjab and Delhi was not unexpected. 
There is no doubt that the aftermath of partition was a terrible 
thing and the Indian people are greatly indebted to Lord and 
Lady Mountbatten for their services during this period They 
remained steadfast friends of India after their departure from this 
country. 

Now to the book, Freedom at Midnight. The greatest blunder 
Mountbatten committed was to be taken in by Shaheed Suhrawar- 
dy and to send to the British Government the plan of Operation 
Balkan. Mountbatten had even discovered that Jinnah would not 
oppose the idea. It did not occur to Mountbatten that he should 
find out whether Nehru would support the idea. If he thought that 
he could impose it, he was sadly mistaken. I was with Nehru at the 
Viceregal Lodge in Simla early in May 1947 when Mountbatten 
suddenly got a "hunch" to informally consult Nehru belatedly on 
Operation Balkan. Nehru's reaction was understandably violent; 
and I was with him when he stormed into Krishna Menon's room 
past midnight. Mountbatten had to do his homework all over again. 
Nehru almost lost faith in Mountbatten and the latter had to restore 
it. The amusing thing is that Mountbatten conveniently forgot all 
about his blunder and has glorified his "hunch" ! 

Freedom at Midnight has referred to Gandhiji's relations with 
Manu at Noakhali. Apparently the authors did not know that this 



Lprd Mountbatten and "Freedom at Midnight" 45 

aspect of the great man's experiment with Truth started long years 
before while his wife Kasturba was still alive. Kasturba had 
panted permission to Gandhiji for this. All the women in Gandhi- 
ji s entourage were involved in this, including the late Rajkumari 
Amnt Kaur who spoke to me freely and frankly about it. Gandhi- 
ji confided in Rajkumari Amrit Kaur that more than once, during 
the experiments, evil thoughts entered his mind. Most of Gandhiii's 
principal colleagues privately protested, without success, against 
this practice. All of them finally appealed to Nehru to persuade 
Gandhiji o give it up. Nehru stoutly refused to interfere in such 
an intensely personal matter. Pyarelal has written about it and we 
Indians accept what he says. This experiment is not to be under- 
taxen by ordinary mortals.

Mountbatten of Burma, KG, PC, GCB, OM,

Tall and handsome, conscious of his lineage, Lord Mountbatten 
arrived in Delhi as Viceroy, Governor-General and Crown Repre- 
sentative on 22 March 1947 with a mission to demolish the empire 
of India of which his great grandmother, Queen Victoria, was the 
first Empress. He had all the advantages of birth. 

Looking back in perspective, I am often wonder struck how the 
gigantic operation of the transfer of power in the Indian sub- 
continent from British to Indian hands was carried out in less than 
five months, 

Mountbatten was a human dynamo where work was concerned. 
He possessed the German thoroughness reinforced by his naval 
career. Meticulous in his attention to detail, Mountbatten had the 
remarkable capacity to get the best out of his well chosen staff. 
Each member was made to feel that he was a partner in a common 
endeavour. Mountbatten had a well ordered mind and great 
organizing capacity. 

Mountbatten was the blue-eyed boy of Winston Churchill, who 
extracted from the Americans the job of Supreme Commander, 
Southeast Asia, for him. His experience in Southeast Asia, 
including India, during wartime made him a liberal despite his 
aristocratic background and loyalty to Winston Churchill. Lady 
Mountbatten was more of a liberal endowed with humanism 
and unbounded compassion. They both had the rare quality of 
evoking the trust of common people. Jinnah was, of course, 
an exception. 

A grateful nation offered the last Viceroy the first Governor- 
Generalship of independent India. The government and people of 
Britain, including the King, were pleased about it. The Mount- 



battens were vastly touched by this gesture. Mountbatten was 
sworn in as the constitutional Governor-General on 15 August 1947. 
Before Mountbatten came to India as Viceroy, he was given the 
title of Viscount. On the eve of the independence of India, his title 
was raised to Earl. Mountbatten was rather too fond of titles and 
decorations. After several months as Governor-General of free 
India, Mountbatten persuaded Nehru to send a humble duty 
submission to the King to confer on him the title of Marquis. 
I tried to dissuade the PM by saying that Mountbatten was indulg- 
ing in wishful thinking and that the King would turn down 
the proposal as such quick enhancement of titles was not normally 
allowed. The PM said, "What does it matter? We don't lose 
anything," and the submission was sent off. The PM received 
a negative reply from Lord Lascelles, Private Secretary to the King. 

One thing about Mountbatten I could never understand — the 
amount of time he spent on his family tree. He revelled in this exer- 
cise almost as an elevating hobby. He took delight in reeling out 
names of his aunts, sisters, cousins, nephews and nieces who were 
members or royal families, past and present, throughout Europe 
and Russia. It is a formidable list. It all came out of his German 
ancestry. As Nepal is an exporter of soldiers, Germany used to be 
an exporter of princes and princesses. During the early part of the 
first world war, Bernard Shaw said, "It is a war of the German 
Kaiser, the German Czar of Russia, the German King of England, 
and Monsieur Poincaire." Soon Mountbatten's father Prince 
Battenberg was renamed Marquis of Milford Haven, and King 
George V renamed his House from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor 
which prompted the Kaiser to say in jest that Shakespeare's 
Merry Wives of Windsor would henceforth be known in Germany 
as the Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The young Louis 
Bettenberg adopted the English equivalent Louis Mountbatten. 
Mountbatten continues to be a prominent member of the Society 
of Genealogists in London. 

In May 1948 Mountbatten invited Nehru to spend a few quiet 
days with him and his family at the Viceroy's Retreat at Mashobra 
in Simla. I was the only one to accompany Nehru to Mashobra on 
that trip. While we were there, no pompous formality was observed. 
Mountbatten used to drive us personally up the Hindustan-Tibet 
road to enjoy a picnic lunch at a rugged but agreeable place called 
Narkanda. He also drove us to Kufri 



48 Reminiscences qf the Nehru A%e 

One evening, after dinner at Mashobra, seven persons, Lord 
Mountbatten, Captain Narendra Singh, The: Lady Pamela, M. O. 
Mathai, Lady Mountbatten, Jawaharlal Nehru and Captain Scott,, 
sat around a circular table sipping coffee. Mountbatten talked about 
the folly of believing rumours. He also said that truth can get 
distorted beyond recognition if it .passes through several mouths. 
He asked all of us to join him in playing a sketching game which 
he called Dame Rumour. The figure to be sketched was that of a 
woman sitting down and playing with her dog in front of a chair, 
Mountbatten would start drawing one line at a time. This was 
supposed^ to be copied by the next person. The third person was 
supposed to copy from the second and not to look at any other 
person's sketch; and so it was to be until the last person around the 
table had finished his sketch. Line after line was drawn at random 
and copied strictly according to instructions, I was the fourth person 
and my sketch turned out to be horrible; Lady Mountbatten's looked 
like nothing oa earth; and the last man, Scott's, was the horror of 
horrors. 

Before we retired, Mountbatten collected all the seven sketches 
and turned to me with a smile and said, "I know you collect all kinds- 
of important documents and manuscripts; keep this junk also.'* 
These sketches (p. 49) have remained with me all these years. 

After being Viceroy and Governor-General of India, Mount- 
batten could have gone as British Ambassador to Washington; 
but he preferred to return to the navy in October 1948, in command 
of a cruiser squadron in Malta, because he wanted to achieve his 
lifelong ambition of becbming the navy's First Sea Lord, an office 
from wmch his father was cruelly hounded out at the outbreak of 
the first world war i?7 the hysterical public outcry and the press 
because of his German origin, In Malta, Mountbatten, who as 
Viceroy had ranked second only to the King Emperor, ranked 
thirteenth ia Malta's order of precedence. 

Mountbatten achieved his ambition and more. On 18 April 1955 
he became the First Sea Lord with the rank of Admiral of the Fleet, 
and in 1958 he was promoted as Chief of the Defence Staff. He 
retired from active service in 1965. Mountbatten had offers of 
Cabinet ministership both from the Labour and Conservative 
governments in Britain. He once told me that he never wanted to 
enter murky politics mostly because he disliked it but partly because 
of his nearness to royalty.

£0 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Lady Mountbatten, the rich heiress, died in Borneo on 21 Feb- 
ruary 1960 and was buried at sea, as she had willed, as a tribute to 
her husband's naval career. Appropriately enough the Indian frigate 
frishu! escorted the British frigate Wakeful which carried her body 
to the sea off Spithead. 

Ever since they left this country on 21 June 1948, the Mount- 
battens remained genuine friends of India. 

Mountbatten has an almost insane desire to loom larger than life 
in history. He would never write anything about himself; but would 
take infinite pains to encourage and help others to write about him. 
And, of course, he lacks the detachment of an historian's mind. 

It will be a great day for Mountbatten, the genealogist, if he is 
alive to watch his grandnephew, Prince Charles, ascending the 
British throne, when the name of the House of Windsor will 
stand changed to the House of Mountbattens. 



8 Churchill Nehru and India 



Winston Churchill had two pronounced blind spots— India and the 
Suffragette movement. Aneurin Bevan, the fiery Welshman, had 
this in mind when lie flayed Churchill once in parliament and called 
him a frozen adolescent. 

When the first woman, Lady Astor, took her seat in the House 
of Commons, Churchill had an uncomfortable and strange sensa- 
tion. He told some of his friends, "I feel a woman had invaded my 
bathroom where I found myself only with a sponge to defend 
myself." 

Churchill's India was the land he knew as a subaltern. He could 
not conceive of an India without the British. In his speech in the 
House of Commons on 6 March 1947, during the debate on "the 
question of transferring power in India to Indian hands," an agita- 
ted and emotional Churchill, as the leader of the opposition, inter 
alia, said: 

The third mistake was the dismissal of the eminent Indians com- 
posing the Viceroy's Council, and handing over the Government 
of India to Mr Nehru. The government of Mr Nehru has been a 
complete disaster, and a great degeneration and demoralization 
in the already weakened departmental machinery of the Govern- 
ment of India has followed from it. Between 30,000 and 40,000 
people have been slaughtered in warfare between the two princi- 
pal religions. Corruption is growing apace. They talk of giving 
India freedom, but freedom has been restricted since the Nehru 
government has come to power. Communism is growing so fast 
that it has been found necessary to raid and suppress Communist 
centres, which, in our broad British tolerance, we do not do here 
and have never done in India. The steps to freedom so far have been 
marked, by every degree in which British control is relaxed, by 



52 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

restriction of the ordinary individual, whatever his political 
views. It was a cardinal mistake to entrust the government to 
Mr Nehru. He has good reason to be the most bitter enemy of 
any connection between India and the British Commonwealth. 
Such was the situation before the latest plunge which the govern- 
ment have taken. This plunge, added to all that has gone before, 
makes it our duty to sever ourselves from the Indian policy of the 
government and to disclaim all responsibility for the conse- 
quences which will darken and redden the coming years. . . . 

Everyone knows that the fourteen month's time limit is fatal 
to any ordinary transference of power, and I am bound to say 
that the whole thing wears the aspect of an attempt by the 
government to make use of brilliant war figures to cover up a 
melancholy and disastrous transaction. . . . 

In handing over the Government of India to the so-called 
political classes, you are handing over to men of straw of whom 
in a few years no trace will remain. 

A conference of Dominion Prime Ministers took place in London 
between 22 October and 21 October 1948. British Prime Minister 
Clement Attlee presided. Until then it used to be called the British 
Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. At this conference in 
October 1 948, which was attended for the first time by the Prime 
Ministers of India, Pakistan and Ceylon, the word British just drop- 
ped out without any legal step being taken to effect the change. 
From then on it was just the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Con- 
ference. Also, many British non- official institutions dropped the 
word Empire which was substituted by Commonwealth. 

I was in London with Prime Minister Nehru in October 1948 for 
the Prime Ministers' Conference. We were staying at the Claridges 
Hotel. One morning an agitated secretary from India House, attac- 
hed to our delegation office, came to me and said that the leader of 
the opposition, Winston Churchill, was on the telephone and wished 
to speak to Prime Minister Nehru. I took the telephone in the 
Prime Minister's sitting room. Churchill started speaking as if to 
Nehru and I let him continue for a couple of minutes. He was very 
polite, almost to the point of being humble, and pleaded that Nehru 
should have lunch with him the next day and ended up by asking, 
"Won't you please make it possible Mr Nehru?" At that moment 
Nehru came in from his bath. I gave him the telephone and told 



Churchill, Nehru and India 53 

him briefly what had happened and added that he could easily put 
off the rather unimportant lunch engagement the next day and 
accept Churchill's invitation. Nehru spoke to him for a brief while 
over the telephone and accepted the invitation. On his return from 
lunch the next day, Nehru told me that there was no important 
talk. All that happened was that Churchill was trying to make up in 
his own way. 

Immediately after the coronation of Queen Elizabeth IF, a con- 
ference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers took place in London 
from 3 June to 9 June 1953. Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister 
of Britain, presided. As usual I attended it. During my time these 
conferences took place in the Cabinet room of 10 Downing Street. 
Now they are public meetings in some public building. 

As Churchill walked into the room, his presence was immediately 
felt in sharp contrast to Clement Attlee. One sensed "here is a big 
man." He spoke with a lisp and a slight stutter. Churchill could not 
achieve his ambition of becoming a great orator; but he became a 
master of the written word and a coiner of phrases. Whenever he 
was pleased with a phrase that he had coined, he liked to keep on 
repeating it. Churchill considered Lloyd George and Aneurin 
Bevan, both Welshmen, as great orators. Stating that an orator 
should be spontaneous, he once said, "When that fellow Bewngets 
up, he does not know what he is going to say and where he will end; 
but I have every word written out in front of me." But Churchill 
was not wholly free from plagiarism. Here are some examples: 

Referring to Hitler's threat that England's neck would be wrung 
like a chicken, Churchill, in his famous speech to the Canadian 
parliament, used the phrase "some chicken, some neck!" He was 
parodying Lawrence of Arabia. 

Churchill's first speech in the House of Commons after becom- 
ing Prime Minister in 1940 contained the phrase "blood, toil, sweat 
and tears." This was lifted from Byron's poem "The Age of 
Bronze.*' 

"Hell knows no fury as a woman scorned." This is downright 
stealing of William Congreve's couplet, "Heaven has no rage like 
love to hatred turned/Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned." 

Churchill's phrase "iron curtain" is not original. The words first 
appeared in Ethel Snowden's Through Bolshevik Russia in 1920. Its 
wider application to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence 
originated with Goebbel's leading article in the issue of the weekly, 



54 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Das Reich, dated 25 February 1945. In that he had said: 

Should the German people lay down its arms, the agreement 
between Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin would allow the 
Soviets to occupy all Eastern and Southeastern Europe together 
with the major part of the Reich. An iron curtain would at 
once descend on this territory which, including the Soviet 
Union, would be of enormous proportions. 

Nehru has never been accused of plagiarism. 

Churchill attached great importance to the correct use of words. 
Once, at the dinner table, Churchill told his wife, "You ought 
not to say very delicious. 'Delicious' alone expresses everything 
you wish to say. You would not say 'very unique'." In this con- 
nection LordMoran says that Churchill once thought of including 
the following in a speech at a university: 

A man called Thompson went to a surgeon and asked him to 
castrate him. The surgeon demurred; but when the man persis- 
ted and argued, he eventually agreed and took him into hospi- 
tal. The morning after the operation Thompson woke up in 
great discomfort. He noticed that the man in the next bed was 
in pain and was groaning. He leaned towards him over the side 
of the bed. 'What did they do to you' he asked. The man replied 
'I have been circumcised'. 'Good Lord' Thompson exclaimed, 
'that is the word I couldn't remember when the surgeon asked 
me what I wanted done'. 

One evening Churchill was sitting on his bed and shouting for 
his hotwater bottle. The valet appeared. Churchill asked him 
where the hotwater bottle was. The valet replied, "You are sitting 
on it Sir; not a good idea." Churchill smiled and replied, "It is 
not an idea but a coincidence." 

Atone session of the conference of June 1953 Churchill became 
emotional about the Indian army and used superlative language 
for it. "Any day a couple of divisions of the Indian army for me, 
Mr Nehru," he said. 

The last session of the conference was, as usual, devoted to the 
finalization of the communique. The Prime Ministers had before 
them a draft prepared by senior officials of the delegations. It was 



Churchill, Nehru and India 55 

fascinating to see Churchill and Nehru, two masters of the correct 
use of words, in action. Whatever changes Nehru suggested were 
accepted by Churchill by his murmurs of approval. 

Outside the conference, Churchill went out of his way to hum- 
our Nehru. He was instrumental in arranging a dinner for Haro- 
yians in honour of Nehru, Both Churchill and Nehru were products 
of Harrow Public School. 

One morning at 10 Downing Street, British Cabinet Secretary 
Lord Norman Brook took me aside and told me that at a private 
function the previous evening a prominent person spoke disparag- 
ingly of Nehru, Churchill at once rebuked him sharply and said, 
"Remember he is a man who has conquered fear and hate." 

The day before our leaving London after the conclusion of the 
conference, Churchill sent a brief handwritten letter to Nehru 
saying, "Remember what I told you— you are the Light of Asia." 
What a transformation in Churchill! 

On 3 February 1955 Lord Moran asked Churchill about Nehru. 
Churchill said, "I get on well with him. I tell him he has a great 
role to play as leader of free Asia against communism." Asked 
how Nehru took it T Churchill replied, "Oh, he wants to do it, and 
I want him to do it. He has a feeling that communists are against 
him* and that is apt to change people's opinion." 

Contrary to the general impression, neither Churchill nor Nehru 
were widely-read men. They wrote and spoke more than they read 
in their lives. 

Churchill and Nehru shared a common allergy towards the 
American Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. In private con- 
versation Churchill called Dulles a "dull, clumsy bastard" and 
hoped he would disappear. At another time he said of Dulles, 
"This fellow preaches like a Methodist priest, and his bloody text 
is always that nothing can come out of meeting with Malenkov." 
And at another time he observed, "Dulles is clever enough to be 
stupid on a rather large scale." Nehru took delight in repeating 
"Dull, Duller, Dulles:" He once observed, "Krishna Menon is my 
answer to Dulles." This came out of Nehru's abundant vanity. 
Nehru once told me that he knew he had an ample measure of 
vanity, hut that he was also capable of humility. 

Very seldom did Nehru use swear words. I have heard him use 
"bloody" only once— about a person whose identity I shall not 



56 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

disclose. But to Churchill this and other choice epithets came 
naturally and prolifically. 

Churchill was not given to self-criticism; neither was he vain. 
Nehru was given to self-criticism; and he had self-confessed vanity. 

Ever since he became Prime Minister during England's darkest 
hour in 1940, Churchill never slept without the aid of sedatives. 
Until two years before his death, Nehru's was a singularly unme- 
dicated body. 

Churchill was a great admirer of Napoleon. He kept in his 
bedroom at Chartwell two small sculptured heads— one of Napo- 
leon and the other of Nelson. One day, when Lord Moran was 
looking at Napoleon's head, Churchill remarked, "Ah, what was 
the most beautiful countenance from which genius ever looked 
upon mankind. He was a very wonderful man. I put him after 
Julius Caesar. Yes, he is at the top." Nehru, in his Glimpses of 
World History, has drawn a rather superficial picture of Napoleon 
about whom Lord Acton said in his Cambridge Lectures on 
Modern History, "No intellectual exercise can be more invigorat- 
ing than to watch the working of the mind of Napoleon, the most 
entirely known as well as the ablest of historic men." 

The introduction to the first of the two great works (written in 
1890) that Count Albert Vandal left announced the spirit in which 
he intended to approach Napoleon. The subject was the relations 
between Napoleon and Alexander of Russia from 1807 to 1812, 
that is, the foreign policy from the period of the greatest power to 
the beginning of the disaster. For Vandal there was something 
fascinating and imposing about the gigantic historical figure in 
itself. Something which silenced criticism. With Pozzo di Borgo, 
one of the men who hated and admired Bonaparte most, he says 
that to "judge Napoleon would be like judging the universe." 

Vandal felt admiration "for the genius which carried out or 
inspired amazing deeds, whose magical power raised to their high- 
est pitch those qualities of honour, audacity, obedience and dedi- 
cation, which are peculiar to our people, for him who, having 
reconciled our nation with itself, created from it an army of 
heroes, and for a time lifted the Frenchman above mankind." 

In August 1942, in Cairo, Field Marshal Smuts spoke to Chur- 
chill about Mahatma Gandhi and said that "he is a man of God. 
You and I are mundane people. Gandhi has appealed to religious 
motives. You never have. That is where you have failed." Chur- 



h 



Churchill, Nehru and India 57 

chili, with a broad grin, replied, "I have made more bishops than 
anyone since St Augustine," 

Nehru lacked the toughness of Churchill and Churchill-type 
courage in adversity. He wilted in the wake of the Chinese attack 
on India. His health could not stand up to the mental strain. 
Many things which he valued crashed around him. Finally his 
health collapsed. The Chinese perfidy in returning evil for good 
hastened the death of the Man of Peace. 

The last of Churchill's great speeches in the House of Commons 
was on the hydrogen bomb in February 1955, two months before 
his retirement. He wound up by saying, "All the countries of the 
world might feel so vulnerable that, cowed by fear, they might at 
last be content to live in peace. Then it may well be that by the 
process of sublime irony they have reached a stage in this story 
that safety will be the sturdy -child of terror, and survival the twin 
brother of annihilation." Churchill took twenty hours on the pre- 
paration of this speech and eight hours on checking facts. 

Neither Churchill nor Nehru made use of ghost writers for 
their speeches as is the case in present day India. Nehru was by 
no means an orator; but he made several moving speeches, both 
extempore and written, whenever he was emotionally stirred. 

After he suffered a stroke in 1953, when death seemed round the 
corner, Churchill confided to his famous physician, Lord Moran, 
not, however, without many qualifications, that he had been wrong 
about India. Lord Moran later commented, "But the circumstances 
were exceptional, for the confessional was a sick bed." And yet the 
last of the great imperialists had traversed a long way. 

In this chapter I have drawn upon material contained in Lord 
Moran* s bulky book on- Churchill. 



9 Nehru's Meeting with Bernard Shaw 



It was at Ayot St Lawrence on Friday, 29 August 1949, when 
Shaw was ninety-three years old. He died the following year. 

Earlier Shaw had insisted on sending his car. He wrote to the 
Indian High Commission in London at the bottom of a printed 
sheet of elaborate directions on how to get to his house at Ayot St 
Lawrence: 

My car will be at Claridges on Friday at half past nine. It is a 
Rolls Royce limousine and will hold three fat passengers or four 
slender ones. It will be at your disposal all day, and can take you 
back to London or on to Romsey just as it suits you ; 

There is only one taximan in London who knows the way. His 
telephone number is 5257. But this is only in case of accident. 

I accompanied. Nehru on this trip. No one else was present. We 
travelled in Shaw's car. Krishna Menon's Rolls Royce limousine 
followed, without any passengers in it, for our return journey. 

Shaw's residence was unpretentious but adequate. The meeting 
took place In his study. Shaw looked healthy for a man of his age; 
and we were to discover during the course of the meeting that his 
mind was alert. 

During the meeting Nehru was unusually quiet and opened his 
mouth only once. The conversation began with Shaw referring to 
his meeting with Gandhiji in London in the early thirties. He said 
that Gandhiji sat on the floor, but gave him a chair. Shaw did not 
go into the details of his talk with Gandhiji. When the interview 
with Gandhiji was over, Shaw said that he was sent back home in a 
car driven by an impressive-looking Indian chauffeur with a magni- 
ficent turban. On alighting from the car, Shaw gave the chauffeur 
half a crown which the latter accepted with a smite and grace not 



Nehru's Meeting with Bernard Shaw 59 

normally associated with chauffeurs. Then Shaw began to chuckle 
and said that he later discovered that the chauffeur was in fact an 
Indian Maharaja! Shaw went on chuckling for some time. 

Referring to the Labour government, Shaw said it had, on the 
whole, done well. He described Attlee as a colourless person but a 
good committee chairman. Shaw had a special good word for Staf- 
ford Cripps and referred to the latter's vegetarianism and close 
association with Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Shaw said that Ernest 
Bevin was a disaster as Foreign Secretary. According to Shaw, 
Bevin suffered from a total lack of the sense of history. He was con- 
vinced that no trade union leader was fit to be Foreign Secretary. 
He said that Bevin was a despot who often shouted Attlee down. 
Shaw expressed the view that the only person eminently qualified 
to be the British Foreign Secretary was Konni Zilliacus, an ultra 
leftist Labour MP, who was expelled from the Labour Party for 
welcoming the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia. 

Shaw dismissed the United States as supremely immature and, 
as such, dangerous. He was of the firm view that the atom bomb 
would never be used again. 

It was amusing to see Shaw rave against the government on 
income tax. This was nothing new. Winston Churchill said of him, 
"Shaw has always preached the ownership of all forms of wealth 
by the state; yet when the Lloyd George budget imposed for the 
first time the slender beginnings of the super tax, no one made a 
louder squawk than this already wealthy Fabian. He is at once an 
acquisitive capitalist and a sincere communist." Shaw went on 
squawking about the income tax till the end of his days. He also 
had a highly developed sense of business. 

Shaw told Nehru that he sincerely felt that Nehru and Stalin 
were the only hope of the world. He ridiculed the British local coun- 
cils and said they were composed of duds. Shaw declared with 
earnestness that the parliamentary system was unsuitable and advi- 
sed Nehru to "try the Soviet system which is a quicker system." 
He firmly said that only ten per cent can govern. He laid tremendous 
emphasis on governing. At this stage Nehru intervened and asked, 
"But, Mr Shaw, who wants to govern?" Shaw's reply was, "Whe- 
ther you like it or not, you have to." 

Shaw complained, "People call me mad; but the trouble is they 
do not listen to me." 

Shaw related the story of an Indian, with a mouthful of a name

Nehru's Meeting with Bernard Shaw 61 

(Professor Doraiswami Aiyar), who sent him the manuscript of a 
collection of his poems in English, and asked for his opinion. Shaw 
read the first page and came to the conclusion that the man not 
only did not know how to write poetry, but also how to write 
correct English. Nevertheless, Shaw sent him a postcard reading, 
"Have never seen anything like this before," Shaw began to chuckle 
and said, "The fool published his poems and my opinion," Shaw 
could not contain his laughter for some time. 

Finally Shaw referred to his week's stay in Bombay, but could 
not recollect the dates. He said he was attracted to Jainism which, 
he thought, had much in common with Quakerism. 

It might be mentioned here that between the two world wars 
Shaw had been advocating the abolition of parliamentary institutions 
and setting up dictatorships. In this connection Winston Churchill 
called him "the double-headed chameleon." 

Shaw at last turned to me and asked what book I would like to 
have as a present. I said Dramatic Opinions and Essays. He scruti- 
nized me and said the book was an old one and out of print. He 
added, "If I have a library copy; I shall give it to you." He looked 
all over and could not find one. Then he asked me, "Why do you 
want that particular book?" I told him that when I was a college 
student, I moved a resolution in the College Debating Society that 
"we have had enough of Shakespeare," and that I had used many 
of the brilliant arguments in that book in support of my resolution. 
Shaw was all attention and eagerly asked me, "What was the 
result?" I said, "The resolution was thrown out; even the seconder 
of the resolution deserted me and voted against it." I added that I 
was the only one who voted for it. Shaw chuckled. Then he selec- 
ted the book Major Critical Essays for me, autographed it and gave 
it to me. For Nehru he selected the book, Sixteen Self-Sketches 
and' autographed it. He wrote Nehru's first name as "Jawaharial." 
I at once pointed out the mistake to Shaw who contested what I 
said. He turned round in his swivel-chair and brought out from his 
revolving bookcase Nehru's autobiography. Shaw discovered his 
mistake, looked at me with a mischievous smile and said, "Keep it 
like that; it sounds better!" 

We then gave him some Chausa mangoes. Shaw was under the 
impression tfiatit was the nut which was to be eaten. At that 
time Shaw's housekeeper came in answer to the bell. Nehru explain- 
ed to both that what was to be eaten was the pulp covering the nut. 



62 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Nehru also explained how the mango was to be cut and eaten. 

At this time we all rose and came out. Shaw posed for photogra- 
phs with us. 

So we said farewell to the one described by Winston Churchill 
as 

the saint, sage and clown; venerable, profound and irrepressible; 
Bernard Shaw receives, if not the salutes, at least the hand-clap- 
pings of a generation which honours him as another link in the 
humanities of peoples, and as the greatest living master of letters 
in the English-speaking world. 

We drove straight to Lord Mountbatten's house where Lady 
Mountbatten asked, "Did either of you succeed in putting in a word 
edgeways?" I said I did. 

Bernard Shaw acquired the reputation of being a chatterbox 
rather early in life. The only instance on record when vegetarian 
Shaw was left tongue-tied was when he visited the laboratory of Sir 
Jagdish Chandra Bose in London at the turn of the century. Shaw 
was deeply upset to find that a cabbage had violent convulsions as 
it boiled to death. Shaw literally lost his power of speech and left 
with his head bowed low. 

On my return to Claridges Hotel, I found the correspondent of 
a famous American newspaper waiting for me. He requested me to 
give him an article on our meeting with Bernard Shaw. The indu- 
cement was considerable. I gave him my excuses and offered to 
give him free an article on the matriarchal system in Kerala. He 
was intrigue^, stared at me and left. 



10 C. Rajagopalachari 



I have also referred to Rajaji in the chapter "Rajendra Prasad and 
Radhakrishnan." 

Endowed with a razor-sharp intellect and an analytical mind, 
Rajaji would peel an onion,, layer after layer, to find out what an 
onion really was. He had the peculiar gift of alienating people. 
The man with the dark glasses would make most of his visitors 
feel that they were fools. This did not help in acquiring and 
retaining popularity. But he was a man of rare moral courage. He 
did not hesitate to part company from Gandhiji, to whom he was 
devoted and bound by numerous ties. He was not afraid to espouse 
unpopular causes. 

Sarojini Naidu, in a personal talk with me, once compared 
Rajaji and Nehru. She said that "the Madras fox was a dry logical 
Adi Sankaracharya while Nehru was the noble compassionate 
Buddha." 

Indira once related to me what her grandfather, Motilal Nehru, 
said of Rajaji in private. He said, "I cannot fathom what is happen- 
ing behind those dark glasses. I once put a poker into his head, and 
lo! it came out as a corkscrew." Incidentally, Rajaji never cared for 
Indira. He once told me, "I have known that girl as a child in her 
mother's arms. She has not grown since the age of two. She has 
nothing of the father in her." 

Nehru included Rajaji in the interim government which assumed 
office on 2 September 1946 at the instance Of Gandhiji, even though 
at that time Rajaji was particularly unpopular with Congressmen. 
When the dominion government came on 15 August 1947, Rajaji 
agreed to Nehru's request to go to West Bengal as Governor, 
chiefly in view of the deteriorating communal situation there. 

After Rajaji's exit from the office of Govern or- General, relations 
between Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel grew steadily strained. Nehru 



64 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

did not want the deterioration to go further. He missed Gandhiji, 
After considerable thought he sent a personal appeal to Rajaji to 
come to Delhi at once. He came promptly and, after a personal talk 
with Nehru, agreed to join the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio. 
His principal function was to hold the peace between Nehru and 
Patel. He was sworn in on 5 May 1950. After Pat el's death, 
Rajaji succeeded him as Home Minister. 

Once Nehru received a personal despatch from K.M. Panikkar, 
who was our Ambassador in China, complaining that a senior 
Press Trust of India correspondent was sitting in Hong Kong and 
sending despatches to India datelined Peking. These despatches 
were unfavourable to China, containing mostly rumours and 
gossip. At Nehru's instance I sent for K.S. Ramachandran, head 
of the PTI in New Delhi, and conveyed to him Nehru's disap- 
proval of the unethical practice. He promised not to release to the 
press any further despatches from that correspondent who was 
subsequently withdrawn from Hong Kong. Ramachandran then 
told me that Rajaji had also sent for him in this connection and 
told him, "Look, this business of datelining Peking while sitting 
in Hong Kong is a dangerous thing, because the Chinese will one 
day produce these despatches in international forums to prove 
that there is freedom of the press in China. Kill all further 
despatches from the correspondent." The differing approaches of 
the two giants give an indication of their respective personalities. 
One was a noble lion while the other was a wily fox. 

Rajaji continued to be in government until a new government 
was formed in the middle of 1952 after the first general elections. 

Before he left Delhi I met Rajaji and had a talk with him. He 
told me that his plan was to write about simple things, such as 
advice to cyclists and drivers, against spitting on roads and public 
places, and the like. I smiled. Rajaji asked me, "Are you scepti- 
cal?" I said, "Yes. I believe all politicians are like squirrels, and 
you are no exception." Then I told him the Malayalam proverb: 
"No matter how old the squirrel is, it will never give up climbing." 
He laughed. 

After parting from Nehru, Rajaji developed hostility towards 
Nehru's policies. Eventually he formed the Swatantra Party and 
embarked on a course of attacking Nehru's policies relentlessly. 
He proved to be a real squirrel. When the Chinese invasion of 
India took place, Rajaji said of Nehru, "He has made his bed and 



€. Rajagopalaclmri 65 

he must be made to lie on it." Soon after, Rajaji came to Delhi 
and had a personal talk with Nehru during which, surprisingly 
enough, he offered to join the Cabinet and help him. Not so 
surprisingly, Nehru changed the subject by telling him, "You are 
already helping me a great deal from outside." The old squirrel 
took the hint and left. 



11 The Position of the President of India 



On 30 April 1977 Jayaprakash Narayan issued a statement on the 
hesitation of Acting President B.D. Jatti, in spite of the Supreme 
Court's unanimous dismissal of the writ petition of four 
state governments, in signing the proclamations dissolving the 
assemblies of nine states in northern India where the Congress was 
practically wiped out in the Lok Sabha elections of March 1977. In 
his statement Jayaprakash Narayan said, "When President 
Rajendra Prasad raised some queries about the powers of the 
President, they were referred by Mr Nehru to jurists like Mr M.C. 
Setalwad, the then Attorney- General, and to Sir Alladi Krishna- 
swami Aiyar, both of whom opined that the President must be 
guided by the advice of the Council of Ministers." 

Nehru did nothing of the kind. The facts are as follows: Strange- 
ly enough Rajendra Prasad, who had presided over the deliberations 
of the Constituent Assembly and was aware of the trends in that 
august House, developed some doubts, while sitting in Rashtrapati 
Bhawan, about the powers and functions of the President. This 
was in spite of Nehru and Ambedkar having made it abundantly 
clear in the Constituent Assembly that under the Constitution the 
President would function purely as a constitutional head acting on 
the advice of the Cabinet. 

Rajendra Prasad informally sent for all the judges of the Supreme 
Court individually and asked for their opinion. They conveyed to 
him their initial reaction; but they declined to give him anything 
in writing. They told him that they would express their considered 
opinion only if the President formally referred the matter to the 
Supreme Court for advice. Rajendra Prasad did not want to do 
so because any such reference could only be made on the advice of 
the Prime Minister and his Cabinet. The President's Military 
Secretary Major-General B. Chatterjee, who was more political 



The Position of the President of India 67 

than military, kept me informed of the developments privately. 

Then Rajendra Prasad sent for the then Attorney- General 
M.C. Setalvad, who later gave him a note. A copy of this note was 
forwarded to me privately by General Chatterjee. Setalvad had 
clearly stated in his note that the President did not have an exist- 
ence independent of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet In simple 
terms he virtually told Rajendra Prasad that wherever the term 
President occurred in the Constitution, he might as well substitute it 
with the term Prime Minister. I placed before Nehru the copy of 
Setalvad's opinion and gave him a brief account of what had been 
going on in Rashtrapati Bhawan. Nehru read Setalvad's opinion 
and gave it back to me with a smile. He was more amused than 
annoyed. Nehru was so sure of the constitutional position and his 
own personal position and prestige in the country that he chose to 
ignore Rajendra Prasad's aberrations. 

There was no need for some newspapers to attack Jatti. He was 
perfectly within his rights to ask the Cabinet to reconsider the 
decision. 

The framers of the Constitution were content with a simple 
statement, "There shall be a Council of Ministers, with the Prime 
.Minister at the head, to aid and advise the President." Nehru, with 
his commanding position and personality, gave content to this 
during his long period of seventeen years as Prime Minister and, in 
the process, established healthy democratic conventions. 

In several judgments from 1955 onwards the Supreme Court had 
very clearly stated the legal position on the subject of the .powers 
of the President in relation to the Prime Minister and his Council 
of Ministers, 

The much-criticized 42nd Constitutional Amendment clause ad- 
ding, "The President shall, in the exercise of his functions act in 
accordance with such advice" was perhaps unnecessary though 
harmless. If a President is overburdened with conscience/it is 
always open to him to resign. 

The position of the President of India is exactly the same as that 
of the President of the Fourth Republic of France before the advent 
ol De Gaulle and the establishment of the Fifth Republic. 

Noted British historian Sir Henry Maine wrote, "The old Kings 
of France reigned and governed; the King of England reigns but 
does not govern; the President of the United States governs but 



68 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

does not reign. It has been reserved for the President of the French 
Republic neither to reign nor to govern." 

Clemenceau, who was French Prime Minister during the closing 
stages of the first world war, once declared that there were two 
things for which he could never find any reason— the prostate gland 
and the French presidency. 

^ Abbe Lantaigne, more devastating in his characterizations, once 
dismissed the presidency from his writings as "an office with the 
sole virtue of impotence." "Its incumbent," he said, "must neither 
act nor think; if he does either he stands to lose his throne." 

Yet the fact remains that the President of the Republic is the 
supreme representative of the executive power of France. He is the 
head of state and holds the highest political honour that a nation 
can bestow. He sits on the thrones of the Bourbons and the 
Bonapartes. He is the titular Commahder-in- Chief of the armed 
forces on land, at sea, and in the air. He is the first citizen of the 
republic. It is true that the office does not carry powers commensu- 
rate with its dignity, but it is nonetheless a post which the most 
eminent statesmen of France have sought. 



12 Rajendra Prasad and Radhakrishnan 



When the interim government was formed on 2 September 1946, 
Nehru included Rajendra Prasad on the Council as Member in 
charge of Food and Agriculture. He was more interested in develop- 
ing pinjarapoles (cow ashrams) than in the development of food 
production. 

Later in the year, in consultation with Gandhiji and Sardar 
Patel, Nehru, as Congress President, decided to elevate Rajendra 
Prasad as President of the Constituent Assembly which was to meet 
on 9 December 1947. Nehru made it known to Rajendra Prasad, 
whom he called Rajendra Babu, that well before his election as 
President of the Constituent Assembly he should resign from 
government because Nehru felt that the President of a sovereign 
body like the Constituent Assembly should not be a person holding 
a post subordinate to him in government. But Rajendra Prasad 
resisted. Ultimately Gandhiji intervened. He sent for Rajendra 
Prasad and spoke to him bluntly in the presence of one of his 
secretaries, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. Gandhiji told him, "I had 
thought that you learned something from me. I was mistaken. 
You have no right to hold the two offices. In fact you should 
give up everything and join me." Soon after, Rajendra Prasad sent 
in a letter of resignation (p. 70) to Nehru couched in such language 
as to give the impression that it was a spontaneously voluntary act. 

Before the republic came into existence, Rajaji was sitting on the 
throne of the Governor-General of India, once occupied by Warren 
Hastings, Ripon, Curzon and a host of others. He conducted him- 
self with great dignity and simplicity, and foreigners, particularly 
the diplomatic corps, were impressed by him. Nehru wanted Rajaji 
to be the first President. He was anxious to establish a convention 
that normally, if the Prime Minister was from north India the 
President should be from the south, and vice- versa. In fact, Nehru 



70 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

» 

J- ur»Jd £**" /^«^*** *• /^*-«. 

• 

impulsively offered the presidency to Rajaji. Nehru did not like the 
idea of Rajendra Prasad as President because he was very conser- 
vative, traditionalist and somewhat obscurantist. He tried to dissuade 
Rajendra Prasad by offering him the offices of a Cabinet Minister 
and chairmanship of the Planning Commission. Rajendra Prasad 
was not interested in the offer. Nehru soon discovered that the bulk 
of Congress MPs were opposed to Rajaji. Sardar Patel appeared 
neutral though his preference was known. It was not for Rajaji/ If 
Nehru had stood firm, Rajaji would have been elected; but Nehru 
disliked taking any important issue to the breaking point. So, 



Rajendra Prasad and Madhakrishnan 7 1 

ultimately he beat a retreat, leaving Rajaji with an aggrieved feel- 
ing of having been let down. 

Thus Rajendra Prasad became the first President of the Republic 
on 26 January 1950. Alas, the first act of the first President of the 
Republic was the shifting of all Muslim servants from his wing in 
Rashtrapati Bhawan. Nehru was annoyed. He asked me to get all 
these Muslims transferred to the government hospitality organiza- 
tion in exchange for Hindu servants. The displaced Muslim 
servants were detailed to duty in the Prime Minister's house even 
though the security authorities were unhappy about it. 

Another thing which annoyed Nehru was Rajendra Prasad's 
pilgrimage to Kashi to wash the feet of sadhus. Feet-touching then 
onwards became sanctified. If Nehru hated anything, it was 
feet-touching. 

Yet another thing which made Nehru unhappy was Rajendra 
Prasad's visit to Somnath to instal the Shivalingam in the newly 
built temple on the site of the famous one which Moslem invaders 
had destroyed. Nehru had information that the Food and Agricul- 
ture Minister K. M. Munshi, with the connivance of Sardar Patel, 
had raised the sugar price and let the mill owners keep half of the 
price-rise and give the rest for the construction of the Somnath 
temple. The Sugar Mill Owners Association was only too happy to 
perpetrate this fraud on the people. This information came to 
Nehru at a rather late stage when it was not possible to retrieve the 
situation. 

The President, under the transitional provisions of the Consti- 
tution, inherited all the financial allotments enjoyed by the 
Viceroy, including the very substantial entertainment allowance. 
Successive Presidents have resisted all attempts by parliament 
to legislate for the emoluments and perquisites of the President. 
After about five years in office by Rajendra Prasad, the Military 
Secretary to the President sent me a private note . to say that 
Rajendra Prasad had not spent more than Rs 225 per month 
on entertainment and that the rest of the grant was drawn by 
Rajendra Prasad and invested in small savings in the names of his 
numerous grandchildren. I showed the note to the Prime Minister 
who incautiously mentioned it at an informal meeting of the Cong- 
ress Working Committee. Jagjivan Ram reported the matter to 
Rajendra Prasad who got very annoyed with me. 

Soon after T. T. Krishnamachari's budget imposed wealth tax, 



72 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

expenditure tax and gift tax, Rajendra Prasad complained to 
Nehru about how all these would affect him personally. Nehru 
then asked him, in a letter in reply, whether the unused part of his 
entertainment allowance was surrendered to government. This 
silenced Rajendra Prasad, and he could no longer swell the 
coffers of his grandchildren. 

Early in 1957 Nehru impulsively offered the presidency to the 
then Vice-President Radhakrishnan. Nehru thought that after 
seven years in office and at his advanced age, Rajendra Prasad 
would wish to retire. Rajendra Prasad, however, had other ideas. 
He was a candidate for re-election for another term of five years. 
Nehru soon discovered that Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant and most 
of the provincial Congress leaders, including Kamaraj Nadar, were 
in favour of Rajendra Prasad's re-election. Again, Nehru, the true 
democrat, retreated as he was loath to push anything to breaking 
point. This made Radhakrishnan sour. He did not want to conti- 
nue as Vice-President. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad ultimately per- 
suaded him to stay on. As a sop to Radhakrishnan, Nehru changed 
the order in the Warrant of Precedence to make the Vice- 
President number two. Until then the Vice-President ranked 
third, after the Prime Minister. Nehru also made the Vice- 
President entitled to use Indian Air Force VIP aircraft to travel in 
India. Radhakrishnan was mollified. Nehru asked Radhakrishnan 
to lead the Indian delegation to UNESCO, and also encouraged 
him to take increasing interest in the activities of that body. 
He also arranged for Radhakrishnan to go on goodwill visits to 
foreign countries. 

At one time Nehru suggested to Rajendra Prasad that he 
might let Radhakrishnan perform some of his ceremonial func- 
tions. Rajendra Prasad pointed out that, while he held Radha- 
krishnan in great esteem and would gladly entrust him with some 
of his functions, the Constitution did not provide for such a 
course of action. Rajendra Prasad was right. 

At the time of the debate in parliament on the Hindu Code 
Bill, Rajendra Prasad made it known to MPs that he was person- 
ally against it. At this time Rajendra Prasad spoke to Nehru and 
told him that, according to the Constitution, the President 
was part of parliament and that he would like to be in the 
President's Box in parliament whenever he wished to do so. 
Nehru firmly put his foot down and told Rajendra Prasad that his 



Rajendra Prasad and Radhakrishnan 73 

being part of parliament only meant that he had to address the 
joint sessions of both Houses once a year; and that the President's 
Box in parliament was only a courtesy to accommodate distin- 
guished foreign dignitaries and other guests of the President. 
Nehru, however, compromised by facilitating the installation of 
contraptions through which the President, from his study in 
Rashtrapati Bhawan, could listen to the proceedings in both 
Houses of parliament. Such contraptions were also installed for 
Nehru and myself in our offices in Parliament House. 

The relationship between the first President and the first Prime 
Minister was formal. The Prime Minister had a weekly meeting 
with the President to fulfil the constitutional requirement of 
keeping the President informed of developments in the government 
and the country/There was no personal warmth for each other. 
They were poles apart in their outlook. Rajendra Prasad was 
somewhat overwhelmed by Nehru's personality. However, Nehru 
did not fail to show the President all due courtesies; and he was 
deferential to the President in public. 

When Radhakrishnan became President, his relations with 
Nehru were warm and cordial. Radhakrishnan, with his informal 
ways, was able to influence Nehru to a fair extent. But it must be 
said that during the period 1962-64 Nehru was a declining man 
and afflicted by ill-health. 

Nehru once told me that, during the period Radhakrishnan was 
Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, at his first meeting with 
Marshal Joseph Stalin, he behaved in the most informal manner by 
greeting Stalin with, "Hullo. How are you?" and patted him on the 
back. Radhakrishnan did almost the same thing to Queen Elizabeth. 

Philosopher, orator and phrase-maker, Radhakrishnan was 
indisputably the best President India has had so far, representing 
the best traditions and culture of this ancient land. 

The embarrassingly-named Fakhruddin AH Ahmed was the 
poorest specimen. By signing the Proclamation of Internal 
Emergency in June 1975 without Cabinet approval, he amply 
qualified himself for impeachment. However,, it must be said to 
his credit that he knew when to die. 



13 The Prime Minister and his Secretariat 



The Prime Minister's secretariat in India was constituted on an 
ad hoc basis on 15 August 1947, with H.V.R. Iyengar, a senior 
ICS officer, as the Principal Private Secretary. During his brief 
tenure Iyengar was a somewhat overpowering personality. There 
was no doubt about his competence. Somehow he earned the 
displeasure of Sardar Patel, Shanmukham Chetty and John 
Matthai. They all took exception to Iyengar attending Cabinet 
meetings. Eventually Sardar Patel adopted the practice of kicking 
people upstairs. He requested Nehru to release Iyengar for appoint- 
ment as Home Secretary. This was agreed to. In the Prime 
Minister's secretariat he was replaced..by A.V. Pai, also a senior 
ICS officer. Pai was the mildest of men, a very fair-minded person, 
and a perfect gentleman. He was the best PPS Nehru had. Since 
the exit of Iyengar, no PPS has attended Cabinet meetings. 

In 1948, while we were in London, Nehru requested Attlee to 
give me facilities to study the position of the Prime Minister in the 
Cabinet system and the constitution and functioning of his secre- 
tariat. Attlee asked his Cabinet Secretary Lord Norman Brook and 
Treasury Secretary Lord Edward Bridges, formerly Cabinet 
Secretary during wartime under Winston Churchill, to receive me 
and provide me with the necessary facilities. I met both of them 
and had useful discussions with them. Lord Norman Brook also 
prepared a note for me. 

In the United Kingdom the Prime Minister has no statutory 
powers, his powers derive primarily from the fact that he is 
normally the leader of the political party with a majority in the 
House of Commons, and that as such he has been asked by the 
sovereign to be head of the government. The extent to which the 
powers latent in this position are made real depends on two things: 
(0 The personal influence of the Prime Minister over the ministers 



The Prime Minister and his Secretariat 75 

who make up the government. The Prime Minister, if he wishes, 
selects his own ministers. He can do so without consultation, 
although normally he would consult his senior colleagues. Equally! 
he has the power to recommend their replacement or dismissal, and 
he can, by his own resignation, bring about the resignation of the 
whole government; (») The Prime Minister's chairmanship of the 
Cabinet and some of its important committees, particularly the 
Defence Committee. 

The Prime Minister is also the First Lord of the Treasury. 
This department has substantial statutory and other powers, but 
day to day work is under the charge of the Chancellor of the 
Exchequer and the Prime Minister is not directly concerned. 
Nevertheless the Prime Minister does derive one important power 
from his position as First Lord, namely, his ultimate power of 
control of the civil service. The Prime Minister's authority is 
required for major appointments in the civil service, and this is an 
important factor in maintaining the unity of the service as a whole. 
The Chancellor of the Exchequer is obliged to seek the approval 
of the Prime Minister in advance for the budget as a whole, more 
especially for the taxation proposals. 

The Prime Minister does not normally take charge of any 
department. But in the spheres of foreign affairs and defence the 
Prime Minister has a special position. The relationship between the 
Prime Minister and his Foreign Secretary is probably closer than 
that between the Prime Minister and any other minister. Matters 
of political importance are of more frequent occurrence in the 
sphere of work of the Foreign Secretary than perhaps of any other 
departmental minister. All these matters cannot be brought to the 
Cabinet, and for this reason the Prime Minister must keep in close 
touchVith foreign affairs. Normally, when the Foreign Secretary is 
away, his duties are undertaken by the Prime Minister. In the 
sphere of defence, the Prime Minister retains the supreme responsi- 
bility and is Chairman of the Defence Committee. The supreme 
responsibility is not affected by the appointment of a Defence 
Minister. 

Since the Prime Minister has no statutory powers and no depart- 
ment, he has no need for a large staff; to a considerable extent 
he draws his advice and assistance from all departments. He has, 
on the one hand, in the transaction of official business, the advice 



? 6 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

of the Secretary of the Treasury, arid, on the other, in the conduct 
of Cabinet affairs, that of the Cabinet Secretary. 

In keeping with the collective responsibility of the Cabinet, the 
Prime Minister's secretariat is not classified as a department but as 
a personal secretariat. The staff of the Prime Minister's secretariat 
are not responsible for advising on policy or for executing the 
Prime Minister's decisions on policy. They are only gatherers and 
conveyors and, in short, mechanics men. 

The advice which comes to the Prime Minister from depart- 
ments should always have the authority of the departmental 
minister. 

The Prime Minister's secretariat at 10 Downing Street is a 
small, compact body, particularly competent at the lower echelons. 
As the whole burden of government in principle rests on the Prime 
Minister, he can have, as a matter of established practice, any type 
and any number of people to assist him in the discharge of his 
functions. Financial and administrative sanction for the Prime 
Minister's staff is automatic, provided that such demand for staff 
has the personal approval of the Prime Minister. 

Even the Cabinet secretariat in the United Kingdom does not 
have any statutory powers or executive responsibilities. 

Attlee's secretariat consisted of one Principal Private Secretary 
in the grade of Assistant Secretary (equivalent of a senior Deputy 
Secretary in Delhi), four Private Secretaries in the grade of princi- 
pal (equivalent of an Under Secretary in Delhi), one Parliamentary 
Private Secretary, one Public Relations Officer and a complement 
of fifty stenographic and clerical personnel of various grades. Work 
is clearly defined among the Private Secretaries including the 
Principal Private Secretary. The designation of Principal Private 
Secretary does not have much significance as each one is indepen- 
dent of the others and deals with a particular aspect of the Prime 
Minister's work and deals directly with the Prime Minister. 

Some Prime Ministers have included in their personal staffs, in 
addition to their Private Secretaries, one or more' Personal Assistants 
chosen for their expert knowledge in a particular field in which 
they can give special help to the Prime Minister. During wartime, 
Churchill had Oxford Physics Professor Lindemenn. Later he 
became Lord Cherwell and was appointed a Cabinet Minister. 
Attlee's Personal Assistant Douglas Jay also became a minister 



The Prime Minister and his Secretariat 7 7 

eventually. So did Lord Balog who was Wilson's Personal Assis- 
tant. 

I had two meetings with Phillip Jorden, Attlee's PRO. I was 
struck by him. He was for several years a senior foreign correspon- 
dent of the London News Chronicle. Prior to joining Attlee he was a 
senior First Secretary of the British Embassy in Washington. I 
was told that he was a very respected man among journalists in 
London. 

In the United Kingdom there is a Central Office of Information 
under the Lord President of the Council. This is an operating 
department for all ministries. It is not an initiating department. 

Every ministry in the United Kingdom has its own Public 
Relations Officers. These PROs function independently of the 
Central Office of Information, though they make use of it. The 
Prime Minister's PRO is the seniormost in the whole government. 
He deals directly with the Prime Minister. He is concerned only 
with the Prime Minister and the general policies of the govern- 
ment as a whole. He has access to all secret papers that come to 
the Prime Minister's secretariat. Cabinet agenda and Cabinet 
minutes come to him automatically. He is also furnished with 
Cabinet committee papers. There is only one exception in so far as 
the PRO is concerned. He does not normally see defence papers. 

The Prime Minister in the United Kingdom does not normally 
see newspapermen. The PRO is meant to "sell" the Prime 
Minister and his policies to the press at home and abroad. When 
parliament is in session, he has two daily conferences with lobby 
correspondents, who number about fifty. The Prime Minister and 
the Foreign Secretary in the United Kingdom do not, as a matter 
of practice, meet lobby correspondents. All other departmental 
ministers meet lobby correspondents at informal conferences and 
give them advance explanations of forthcoming Bills in parlia- 
ment. 

The PRO also sees American radio commentators once a week; 
American correspondents once a week; some selected correspon- 
dents, including those of the BBC, once a week; Commonwealth 
correspondents once a month; and the Foreign Association once 
a month. 

He also sits on several official committees like the Home 
Information Committee, Ministerial Committee of Information 
and the Economic Information Committee. 



78 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

The Prime Minister allows his PRO a great deal of discretion 
and freedom in giving out news to pressmen. On the whole the 
PROs dealings with the press are off the record and are never 
quoted. 

The PRO is a heavily-worked man and is recognized as such; 
but the Prime Minister has refused to give him an understudy 
as an addition of one more person means a wider circulation of 
secret papers. 

The British Prime Minister's PRO is called a man with a key 
in his hand because he is particularly required to keep all papers 
in a specially designed box before him and to keep the key him- 
self. I could not find a single piece of paper on his desk on both 
occasions that I met him; and sure enough he was playing with 
the key in his hand. 

Prime Minister Nehru's secretariat was gradually reorganized 
according to the British pattern. Eventually, the post of Principal 
Private Secretary was reduced to Joint Secretary without loss of 
efficiency. 

When Lai Bahadur became Prime Minister he wanted L.K. 
Jha as his Principal Private Secretary. Jha stipulated that the 
secretariat should be designated as a department like any other 
ministry, he should be Secretary to the Prime Minister and not PPS, 
and that his position in the Warrant of Precedence should be the 
same as that of the Cabinet Secretary. Without examining these 
demands properly, Lai Bahadur meekly agreed. Jha let Parkinson's 
law rule the roost. He embarked on an expansion programme. A 
Secretary is normally uncomfortable if he does not have some 
Joint Secretaries; and a Joint Secretary will wail if he does not 
have some Deputy Secretaries, and so on down the line. Then 
came Indira who completed the process. In 1958-59 the Prime 
Minister's secretarial stafTconsisted of 129 persons of all categories, 
including chaprasis (peons); and the budget (actuals) was Rs 675,000, 
while in 1976-77 the staff numbered 242 and the budget increased 
to Rs 3.07 million. 

In 1950 I wanted to create a post of PRO in the Prime Minis- 
ter's secretariat and provide him with the status and facilities 
enjoyed by the British Prime Minister's PRO. The Cabinet Secre- 
tary and the Secretary-General of the External Affairs Ministry 
got scent of my proposal. They pleaded with me and said it was 
dangerous to let a journalist see secret papers. I did not agree 



ifte rnme Minister and Ins Secretariat 79 

with them; but I gave up the idea because I was not sure if Nehru 
would make full use of the PRO. In fact, Nehru was his own PRO 
and needed no image builder, 

I once told Nehru that the press conference was an American 
invention to provide a forum for the President. The Prime Minister 
in a parliamentary system has parliament as his forum where he can 
talk his head off. Neither Churchill nor Attlee held press conferences. 
I suggested to Nehru that he might consider giving up the practice. 
While he agreed with me, his vanity prevented him from accepting 
the suggestion. He liked to show off. I have no doubt that some of 
his statements and off the cuff pronouncements at some press con- 
ferences did more harm than good. 

The present Prime Minister will do well to give up all depart- 
mental work. He will be well advised to create a new Ministry of 
Science and Technology and place the Departments of Atomic 
Energy, Electronics, Space Research, and the Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research in it and find a man with a modern mind 
to be the minister. 

Only a Prime Minister who is an intellectual eunuch or obsessed 
with status symbols, or a dilapidated old man will require a 
senior civil servant to head a personal secretariat which in any case 
should be small. 



14 The Prime Minister's House 



When Jawahailal Nehru accepted office in the interim government t 

on 2 September 1946 he was allotted a four bedroom compact 
house at 17 York Road. He was happy with that house. 

During the pre-partition and post-partition period the situation 
was abnormal. The threat to Nehru's life was real. Sardar Valla- 
bhbhai Patel was a worried man. He spoke to me about the inhe- 
rent danger and wanted to strengthen police security, however 
cumbersome and irritating it may be. He wanted me to do what- 
ever was possible to soften Nehru. Soon the grounds of 1 7 York 
Road became a sea of police tents. 

When Nehru became Prime Minister, security arrangements 
were further tightened. Police tents also sprang up outside on the 
road. The whole place became a grotesque police camp. To me 
it became obvious that Nehru should shift from 17 York Road. 
In the spring of 1948, with the concurrence of Sardar Patel, I got 
in touch with Lord Mountbatten and discussed the matter with 1 

him. He told me that the solution lay in Nehru moving into the 
Commander-in-Chief's house where security arrangements would 
not look so provocative. I requested him not to broach the subject 
with Nehru, but to leave the matter to me. I added that in a 
matter like this, the best procedure was to create a situation in 
which Nehru would have no choice. He agreed. 

I reported back to Sardar Patel and requested him to speak to 
Nehru. Sardar Patel walked into Nehru's house one morning (he 
lived next door) and had a talk with him. He appealed to the PM 
to shift to the C-in-C's house. He told Nehru that he was already 
weighed down with deep sorrow at his failure to protect Gandhiji. 
He made it clear to Nehru that he was not prepared to take the 
responsibility for his safety. There was a veiled threat also— that 
he would resign if Nehru did not comply. 



The Prime Minister 's House 

On walking back to his house, Sardar Patel beckoned to me I 
walked with him. He told me, "Jawaharlal kept quiet and his 
facial expresses showed he did not like to shift; but we must 

wt Mo^bX" 0nSeBt Y ° U S ° 3head "*** «* *»*** 
In consultation with me, Mountbatten drew up a note for the 
Cabinet or the redesignate of the Cin-Cs house as the Prime 
Minister s house and for the setting np of the government hospita- 
hty orgamzatmn m the PM&gt; S house along the lines of Government 
House. Tins became a necessity particularly because Indira was 
feckless m runmng a household. She did no, even know wt 
boil an egg. What is worse, she couldn't care less. According to 
the arrangement worked out, the Prime Minister was to pay for 
himself his family and personal guests on the basis of aetua 
expenditure. On my advice, Mountbatten took the unnsua sten of

interest of a poor man who might succeed him as PM, he should 
let parliament enact such a measure and that he personally need 
not avail himself of the facilities. But he remained too subjective 
in regard to this matter. In this connection I must say that Nehru 
was * one of the most inexpensive persons, in so far as personal 
requirements were concerned. It is open to the present parliament 
to enact a suitable measure to provide for a retiring PM. 

The existing Act provides for a salary of Rs 3,000 per month for 
a Cabinet Minister and an entertainment allowance of Rs 500 per 
month. In Nehru's time he and the ministers voluntarily effected 
a cut and brought down the salary first to Rs 2,250 per month arid 
then to Rs 2,000 per month. Since then the value of the rupee has 
come down to 25 paise. There is a strong case for not only restor- 
ing the cuts but also enhancing the emoluments of ministers. To 
quote Gandhiji in this connection is sheer doublethink. Ministers 
and civil servants should be adequately paid to keep them above 
want and free them from temptations. The people of India will not 
grudge it. 

It was a mistake to have converted the Prime Minister's house 
(now called Teen Murti House) to Jawaharlal Nehru Museum. 
Thirteen years have passed since the conversion and people have 
got used to it as a memorial to Nehru. It will be another mistake 
to reconvert it into the Prime Minister's house. Prime Minister 
Morarji has assured me that he has no desire to move into Teen 
Murti House because it will offend the sentiments of millions of peo- 
ple. Even now an average of 1,000 people visit the Nehru Museum 
daily. 

The now Works and Housing Minister Sikander Bahkt has been 
saying profound things about a mansion for the Prime Minister, I 
am afraid he lives in a bygone age. 

At 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister has only a 
couple of suites of rooms for his personal use. All the rest are 
offices and a few are public rooms. 

Tage Erlander, the Social Democratic Prime Minister of affluent 
Sweden, for twenty years lived in a three room flat. His wife was 
a teacher. I happened to known them both. The Swedish Govern- 
ment did not provide him with a car. The PM and his wife had a 
small car which they drove themselves. They could not afford to 
keep a driver. 

Labour Prime Minister Joseph Chiefley of rich Australia lived 



The Prime Minister' s House g3 

in two rooms in a second class hotel near his office. His wife pre- 
ferred to live on their farm as she did not wish to get involved in 
the social whirl of Canberra. The PM was not provided with a car. 
He walked between his hotel and his office. I met him more than 
once in London. He was a most lovable and humble man. 

People like Sikander Bahkt are victims of outmoded ideas of 
oriental splendour. 



15 Use of Air Force Aircraft by the Prime Minister 



In the middle ofI951 the Director of the Intelligence Bureau came 
to see me and expressed his concern for the security of the Prime 
Minister during the campaign in the winter for the first general 
elections. He said that the threat to Nehru's life was very much, 
there. He said he would be unhappy if the Prime Minister 
travelled in regular commercial flights. Anyhow, commercial air 
service was in a rudimentary stage at that time. The Intelligence 
Bureau chief asked me, "Can't anything be done to enable the 
Prime Minister to travel in IAF planes on payment?" I promised 
to consult some people and try to process the matter, 

Later I had a talk with Cabinet Secretary N. R. Pillai. He 
suggested a three-man committee of senior officials to, go into the 
question of the Prime Minister using IAF planes for purposes 
other than official, I spoke to the Prime Minister and he 
appointed a committee with Cabinet Secretary N. R. Pillai 
as Chairman, the Defence Secretary as Member and Tarlok 
Singh, ICS, as Member-Secretary. In the report the committee 
emphasized the security aspect and also the fact that the Prime 
Minister does not cease to be PM when he goes on unofficial tours. 
He can do a great deal of official work in the plane and also- 
at nights wherever he stays. The committee recommended that the 
Prime Minister might use IAF planes for his unofficial tours 
by paying the government for himself and non-officials air fare as 
charged by commercial flights plus halting charges. Official stafF 
and the personal valet travelling with the PM did not have 
to pay. 

The PM asked the Cabinet Secretary to circulate the report to 
members of the Cabinet for discussion in Cabinet and final deci- 
sion. I told Nehru that a recommendation by a committee 
of officials subordinate to him, and a decision thereon by the 



Use of Air Force Aircraft by the Prime Minister 85 

Cabinet which was his creation were not enough to fulfil the 
requirements of propriety in a matter like this. He was somewhat 
annoyed and asked me what else was to be done. I said the ma*ter 
should be referred to an authority independent of the government, 
such as the Comptroller and Auditor- General. I added that it was 
in his personal interest to do so. I also told him that he need not 
himself doit and that I would personally deal with Narahari Rao 
who was then the Auditor-General, He told me coldly, "Do what 
you like." Thereafter I requested the Cabinet Secretary not to fix 
any date for the discussion of his report until I cleared the matter. 

In the meantime, I had; a personal talk with the Auditor- 
General and gave him all the papers. He said he would study the 
file and walk over to my office and see me. He came a couple of 
days later and told me that the argument of the PM's personal 
security under the still rather abnormal conditions was the 
only one he would go by in writing his note on the Cabinet 
Secretary's report. I said, "You should feel free to write anything 
you consider proper." Two days later he wrote his note on the file 
and returned it to me. He accepted the recommendations contained 
in the Cabinet Secretary's note with a significant rider, "This con- 
cession is personal to Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and should not be 
quoted as a precedent." The Auditor-General's note was also circula- 
ted to the members of the Cabinet. Subsequently the Cabinet 
took a decision in the matter. The Auditor-General's note was 
later released to the press. 

In 1951 thelAF VIP flight consisted of only a few Dakotas. Much 
later came the four-engined turbo-prop medium-sized British 
Viscounts. 

In the 1951-52 general election campaign, Nehru did 18,348 
miles by air, 5,682 miles by car, 1,612 miles by train and 90 miles 
by boat. He made 305 speeches to an estimated total audience of 
30 million people apart from reaching infinitely more millions by 
newspapers and radio. He spent 46 days on these tours. 

The Indian Post and Telegraph Department made special 
arrangements to deliver to the Prime Minister by bag official files 
and papers daily and to return to Delhi by bag the files and papers 
the Prime Minister had disposed of the previous day. These arrange- 
ments worked exceedingly well. 

In so far as I know, the successive Prime Ministers after Nehru

never cared to seek fresh concurrence from the Auditor-General 
for their use of XAF planes for unofficial tours. Perhaps they knew 
that the Auditor- General would not agree. Therefore, their use of 
IAF planes for unofficial tours was improper. 

For his foreign tours Nehru normally used Air India's commer- 
cial flights, I can recollect only two occasions when he used the IAF 
Viscounts. One was when he had to visit a chain of countries — 
Syria, the Federal Republic of Germany, Denmark, Sweden, 
Finland, Norway, England, Egypt and Sudan. The other was when 
he visited Saudi Arabia accompanied by a delegation of MPs. On 
both occasions the Air Chief requested me to let the IAF Sy the 
Prime Minister so that his handpicked pilots would get some 
valuable experience. 



16 Rafi Ahmed Kidwai 



If ever there lived a man in India who was absolutely and totally 
secular, it was Rafi as. he was affectionately called by many He 
shared this quality with the Nehrus andSaprus. Rafi was secretary 
to the legendary Motilal Nehru for some years. Of the two men 
Jawaharlal Nehru loved, apart from his father and Gandhiji Rafi 
was one; the other was A.C.N. Nambiar, the revolutionary, 
brother-in-law of the famous Chatto and of Sarojini Naidu a hesi- 
tant associate of Subhas Chandra Bose in Europe during a part of 
the second world war and, after independence, Ambassador of 
India in several European countries- Nehru would often get angry 
with both and shout at them. That was an indication of his per- 
sonal affection for them. Early in 1964, while A. C. N. Nambiar 
(Nanu as Nehru called him) was staying in the Prime Minister's 
house, as he always did whenever he was in India during Nehru's 
lifetime, he told Nehru at the breakfast table, "I feel sad about 
one thing— yon have not got angry with me this time." Nehru 
laughed. He was then an ill man. Before Nanu left for Europe he 
told me, with tears in his eyes, "Panditji will not live for long I 
shall not see him again," and he wept. 

Rafi was a simple man, informal in his ways. He had a large 
number of men who were devoted and loyal to him. In Delhi they 
were called "Ruffians." Rafi kept an open house where his 
followers and other Congress workers could go and partake of his 
generous hospitality. For this purpose he did not mind taking 
money from medium-sized industrialists and traders. He avoided 
big business magnates. Apart from money, he used to take from 
them presents such as watches, fountain pens, pieces of woollen 
material and the like and distribute them to his "Ruffians," of 
whom Feroze Gandhi was one. 

Rafi had a weakness for large cars and fast driving. He was 



Rafi Ahmed Kidwai g^ 

involved in several traffic accidents but was always lucky to escape 
with minor injuries. Once Nehru received a personal letter from a 

\ UP industrialist, not far from Delhi, complaining that Rafi dem and- 

ed and received from him a large car. Nehru wrote to Rafi depre- 
cating this and asked him to return the car at once. Rafi never did. 
Both in UP and at the centre, Rafi was a successful minister. At 
the centre he was an imaginative Minister of Communications and 
did not hesitate to defy tht powerful Tatas in nationalizing civil 

| aviation and introducing night airmail service. As Minister of Food 

and Agriculture he was imaginative but more lucky than others. 

Rafi used to come to the Prime Minister's house often in the 
evenings without appointment. If Nehru was busy with visitors, he 
ivould sit with me in my study and talk endlessly. Once Inflated to 
him something which Feroze Gandhi had told me. He laughed and 
asked me, "Do you believe anything^that Feroze says?" 

While the States Ministry was initiating action against Maharaja 
Pratap Singh of Baroda (he was eventually deposed), Rafi got in 
touch with him and extracted from him Rs 200,000 for the National 
Herald. This was reported to Nehru by Sardar Patel. Nehru 
immediately wrote to Rafi asking him to return the money. Rafi 
replied that he had instructed Feroze Gandhi, Managing Director 
of Associated Journals Limited, to return the amount. Actually Rafi 

I did nothing of the kind. It was amusing that while Rafi was negoti- 

ating with Maharaja Pratap Singh, he had been telling Nehru that 
V.P. Menon had taken several hundred thousand rupees from the 
IMaharaja as a bribe. 

Few people know that Rafi once went to Sardar Patel and offered 
to help him displace Nehru from the government. He was followed 
by Mahavir Tyagi, a "Ruffian." Patel disliked both. He considered 
them politically unscrupulous. Rafi discovered that Patel was a 
-wiser and more far-seeing man than he had thought. 

Nehru was very annoyed and unhappy when Rafi left Congress, 
-and along with Acharya Kripalani and others, formed anew party 
called the KMPP. After some time Nehru sent for Rafi. Kidwai 
was sitting in my study in the Prime Minister's house when Nehru 
walked in and started talking to him. Then Nehru wanned up and 

I fcegan shouting. Nehru told Rafi, "You haven't the intelligence of 

•a mouse." At that stage I left the room and closed the door behind 



90 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

me. Eventually, Nehru went out of his way to get Rafi back into* 
the Congress and the government. 

One day a senior Air Commodore, staff officer from the IAF 
headquarters, rang me up and later came to see me by appointment. 
He told me that Rafi Sahib had requested him to secretly fly out 
large quantities of arms and ammunition to Nepal to be delivered 
to B. P. Koirala who was then fighting against the Nepalese 
authorities. Rati had told him that this had the approval of the 
Prime Minister. He added that the Air Force Chief was aware that 
under certain circumstances government would have to use uncon- 
ventional methods. All he wanted was confirmation that the VM 
had given approval for this venture. I was inclined to tell him to 
forget the whole business and that if the PM wanted any such thing; 
to be done, he would have spoken to the Defence Minister. How- 
ever, I told the Air Commodore that I would check up with the PM 
in the evening, and gave him an appointment for the next morning. 
I mentioned the matter to the PM in the evening, and he became 
furious. He asked me to send for a PA to dictate a letter to Rafi. I 
advised him not to shoot off a letter on this sensitive subject, but 
that he might telephone Kidwai, which he did. The next morning 
the Air.Commodore came. I did my best to explain the position to 
him without unduly compromising Rafi, and asked him to forget 
the whole episode. 

I had two tiffs with Rafi while he was a Union Minister. One 
was about the appointment of U. Srinivasa Malliah as a General 
Secretary of the Congress after Purushottamdas Tandon was ousted 
as Congress President in 1950. I had suggested the names of 
Malliah and Lai Bahadur who was then the Police Minister in UP, 
Rafi did not like Malliah because he was too independent-minded. 
So he combined with Rajaji against Malliah. Rajaji told Nehru that 
Malliah was prone to intrigue. They suggested Nijalingappa, whom 
Nehru did not care for. Nehru spoke to me. I told him that 
Malliah was far less intriguing than Rajaji, and that Malliah was 
not keen on any job and also that I had not spoken to Malliah. I 
added that it would take some persuasion on his part to make 
Malliah agree, Nehru sent for Malliah, who declined the invitation. 
The next day Nehru again sent for Malliah. He told Nehru that he 
was not suited for any desk job. He said he would join as a General 
Secretary only as a helper. Lai Bahadur would direct to him people 



Rafi A hmed Kiawai 9 J 

difficult to manage. Malliah knew that Lai Bahadur was a fence- 
sitter and incapable of saying boo to a goose. Malliah told Nehru 
that he could relieve Lai Bahadur of such and other unpleasant 
tasks. Nehru appointed him; he and Lai Bahadur got on very well. 
When Lai Bahadur became Prime Minister he wanted to include 
Malliah in the cabinet; but Malliah declined the offer. 

The second tiff related to a quarrelsome Communist MP who 
forcibly occupied a house in the Lok Sabha housing pool. Rafi 
espoused his cause and spoke to Malliah who told him that he had 
already told the MP that if he did not voluntarily vacate the house 
within two weeks he would be ejected by the police. Malliah was 
the Chairman of the Housing Committee of the Lok Sabha appoint- 
ed by the Speaker. Malliah gave me all the facts and said that the 
Speaker would stand firm. I asked him not to worry and if Rafi 
intervened with the PM, "I shall see that the PM sends for 
you" and then fee should stand firm, Rafi came and complained to 
Nehru against Malliah. Nehru dictated a strong letter to Malliah. 
I stopped the letter and told Nehru that he might send for Malliah 
and talk to him. I also reminded Nehru that this was a matter with- 
in the jurisdiction of the Speaker who had already turned down the 
Communist MP's appeal. In the meantime the Communist MP 
came to my office in Parliament House. He demanded from the 
PM's Private Secretary an immediate interview with the PM. The 
Private Secretary explained to him that the PM was busy. The MP 
started shouting. He told the PS that Ran Sahib had sent Mm. At 
this stage I intervened and told him that Rafi Sahib should not have 
sent him there. I also told the man that his behaviour was unworthy 
of a member of parliament; and that if he did not stop shouting he 
would be ejected from the room and its vicinity by the security 
guards. He piped down and left after giving me a dirty look. 

The same day the PM met Malliah who explained the whole 
position. Nehru's comment was, "You should have taken strong 
action earlier." Malliah asked, "How can I be strong unless you 
are strong?" Nehru smiled. Later Nehru asked Rafi, "Why did you 
give me wrong information?" Rafi chose to be silent. I always felt 
that whenever Nehru was in possession of the facts, his actions were 
instinctively right. 

Rafi, to a large extent, and Maulana Azad, less so, were respon- 
sible for persuading Nehru to oust Sheikh Abdullah as Chief 
Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in 1953. 



^ 2 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Whatever had been his faults and his unorthodox behaviour, I 
would like to see more of the kind of Rafi in India. He died a poor 
man. In many ways Rafi was a delightful person. Like Abou Ben 
Adhem, he was one who loved his fellow men. 



1 7 Feroze Gandhi 



Son of a Parsi liquor and provision merchant of Allahabad,. 
Feroze Gandhi in his early days attached himself to Kamala Nehru 
as a Congress volunteer. He used to accompany her as a helper 
wherever she went on Congress work in the Allahabad area. He 
could not be accused of possessing any eagerness for studies. 
Throughout his life he retained the handwriting of a child. 

Towards the end of December 1935 at Badenweiler in Germany, 
Kamala Nehru had a talk with her husband in the presence of" 
their common friend Nanu (A.C.N. Nambiar). Death for Kamala 
was only two months away. She said that she was profoundly 
worried about the future of Indira. She expressed her strongest 
disapproval of the possibility of Indira marrying Feroze Gandhi. 
She did not consider Feroze Gandhi a stable person; neither did she 
think that he was in the least qualified to go into any worthwhile 
profession and support Indira. She spoke with emotion and became 
tired. With some effort she managed to add, "I do not want 
my child to be unhappy all her life." Nehru spoke in a soothing, 
and reassuring manner and said, "You leave the matter to me." A. 
few minutes later Nehru went out. Kamala turned to Nanu and. 
said, "You heard what he said; Indu will listen to no one except 
me. I could have guided Indu gently away from Feroze. But my 
end is near. Jawahar will give no guidance to Indu. She will 
ultimately be allowed to commit the mistake of her life." 

Some time before Kamala Nehru's death on 28 February 1936, 
while Indira was still a student in England, Feroze Gandhi managed 
to get some financial assistance from one of his aunts and went to 
London. His "studies" in London constituted a standing joke 
among Indians there. 

Like many other Indian students in England, Indira managed to- 
return to India by ship after the second world war broke out.. 



94 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Feroze Gandhi was also back. In 1941 Indira spoke to her father 
about her wish to marry Feroze Gandhi. Nehru remembered what 
his wife had told him at Badenweiler and gave her good advice 
against the marriage. All the members of the Nehru family were 
also against the marriage. Neither they nor Nehru could reconcile 
themselves to the idea of Indira marrying the son of a local liquor 
and provision merchant. And, what was worse, the boy was not 
qualified to enter any worthwhile profession to earn his livelihood. 
As opposition to the marriage persisted, Indira adopted a truculent 
attitude. She told her father that she had' no roots in India and that 
she was going to leave the country. Nehru was deeply hurt. He 
conveyed this to Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit and Padmaja Naidu who 
happened to be in Allahabad. Padmaja Naidu expressed the view 
that in the ultimate analysis the father had no right to stand in the 
way of a daughter who was a major. Reluctantly, Nehru gave his 
permission. 

For some inexplicable reason, Nehru allowed the marriage to be 
performed according to Vedic rites in 1942. An interreligious and 
intercaste marriage under Vedic rites at that time was not valid in 
law. To be legal, it had to be a civil marriage. So, strictly under 
the law, Indira was only a "concubine?* and her children are 
"bastards." 

Soon after the marriage, Nehru had Feroze Gandhi appointed 
as the Managing Director of the Associated Journals Ltd which 
owned the National Herald, Navjivan and Quami Awaz. This had 
disastrous consequences which have been mentioned in the chapter 
"National Herald, etc." I have also referred to Feroze Gandhi, in 
the chapter "Ran Ahmed Kidwai." 

In the meantime, Feroze Gandhi continued to do some work as 
an insurance agent and eked out an existence. 

At Nehru's instance, UP Chief Minister Govind Ballabh Pant 
saw to it that Feroze Gandhi was elected to the Constituent 
Assembly when it was constituted in December 1946. After that 
he divided his time between Delhi and Lucknow. He was elected 
to the first Lok Sabha in the 1951-52 general elections and conti- 
nued to be an MP till his death in 1961. 

In 1947 Feroze Gandhi fell in love with one of Mrs Pandit's 
daughters working as an apprentice journalist in the National 
Herald at Lucknow. On hearing this, Mrs Pandit made an air-dash 



Feroze Gandhi 95 

to India from Moscow at her own- expense and took away the girl 
to Moscow, 

Two instances of what Nehru had said in private at the dining 
table leaked out and caused embarrassment. These were traced to 
Feroze Gandhi. Since that time Nehru rarely opened his mouth at 
mealtimes if Feroze Gandhi was present. Even time, the great 
healer, did not help Nehru to become wholly reconciled to his 
daughter, and only child, being married to Feroze Gandhi. Neither 
■did developments after the marriage provide any cementing factor. 

Some time in 1948, Minister of Health Rajkumari Amrit Kaur 
told .me that in her presence Feroze Gandhi had told a group of 
MPs in the Central Hall of parliament that "M.O. Mathai is the 
Prime Minister's son-in-law" and not he. Some MPs later thought 
that Feroze Gandhi had said this because I was with Nehru all the 
time, even in the car in which he travelled between his offices and 
residence, and the fact that I was staying in the Prime Minister's 
house. 

Feroze Gandhi had another romantic interlude. This time it was 
the daughter of a Muslim minister of the UP government. The 
girl was working in the All India Radio in New Delhi. They 
decided to marry. Feroze Gandhi spoke to Indira about his inten- 
tion. She told him that she had no objection. He said he wanted 
the custody of the first child. She firmly refused to consider this. 
The same evening he left a brief note on Nehru's desk in his 
study at the PM's house. In the note he said, "This time it is all 
my fault." Nehru sent for him after dinner and let him have his 
say. The next morning, after breakfast, Nehru took Indira to his 
study and told her that Feroze Gandhi had had a talk with him the 
previous night. He did not reveal to her all that transpired. How- 
ever, Nehru asked her one question, "Have you anyone else in 
view?" She replied in the negative. In the evening Indira reported 
everything to me and complained that her father was not frank 
with her. As a daughter she expected him to tell her everything 
Feroze Gandhi had told him. I told her that it was obvious that 
her father did not wish to repeat anything and create further mis- 
understandings. 

When the news of the romantic developments surrounding his 
daughter reached Lucknow, the Muslim minister was perturbed. 
He frantically came to Delhi and took his daughter away. 



96 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age- 

Soon after this incident Feroze Gandhi shifted to his MP's 
quarters. 

After his exit from the National Herald, a job was found for 
Feroze Gandhi by Ran" Ahmed Kidwai in the Indian Express. Soon 
after Rafi's death, information reached Nehru that Ramnath, 
Goenka, the proprietor of Indian Express, had told someone that 
he gave the job to Feroze Gandhi because Rafi had told him that it. 
would lead to the lessening of Nehru's financial burden; and that it 
was for the same reason that a second large Austin car was also 
allotted to Feroze Gandhi for the personal use of Indira. The Prime 
Minister asked me to question Ramnath Goenka about it. I did so 
and Goenka confirmed that the information which reached the Prime- 
Minister was entirely correct. I told him that the large Austin car 
was never used by Indira. I reported to the PM the substance of 
my conversation with Goenka. He was visibly upset. I told him that 
Goenka had issued instructions to withdraw the large Austin car. I 
also told him that it was inadvisable to take any further step in the 
matter at that stage. 

After Feroze Gandhi's virulent attack on T.T. Krishnamachari 
in parliament in the "Mundhra" case and TTK's resignation from 
government, Ramnath Goenka, who was a personal friend of 
TTK's, terminated Feroze Gandhi's services with the Indian 
Express. 

The misgivings of Kamala Nehru expressed in anguish on her 
deathbed had come true in full measure. 



18 The ''National Herald'' and Allied Papers 

Towards the end of 1955 an agitated Indira came to my study in 
the Prime Minister's house and said that her father had just told 
her that Feroze Gandhi and Ajit Prasad Jain had had a talk with 
him, and that they were going to hand over, the National Herald 
and allied newspapers to C. B. Gupta, the UP Congress boss, 
because of acute financial difficulties. Feroze Gandhi and Ajit 
Prasad Jain had already left for the railway station to go to 
Lucknow. Indira asked me if anything could be done to retrieve 
the situation. I asked the staff to ring up the Delhi railway station- 
master and ask him to trace Feroze Gandhi and Ajit Prasad Jain 
and bring them to the telephone. Indira spoke to Feroze Gandhi 
and asked him not to proceed with his proposal. Feroze Gandhi 
was in charge of the National Herald in his capacity as Managing 
Director of the Associated Journals Ltd. He was a man with no 
constructive ability. However, he was adept at attacking people 
in parliament. He was initiated into it by Finance Minister CD. 
Deshmukh as a prelude to the nationalization of life insurance." 
Deshmukh asked his senior officials to supply Feroze Gandhi 
with secret information. Deshmukh wanted to generate advance 
hostility to life insurance companies in parliament. Thus Feroze 
Gandhi came to know a number of senior officials who proved 
useful to him in his attacks on others later on. 

I remembered that during the independence struggle Nehru 
had said, "I would gladly sell Anand Bhawan to keep National 
Herald alive." I decided to do something to put the affairs of the- 
Associated Journals Ltd on a sound footing. I. met the then 
Attorney-General M. C. Setalvad and told him of a proposal to 
create a trust to aid these newspapers. As recommended by him 
the trust deed was drafted by C.C. Shah, MP, whom the Attorney- 
General considered an able solicitor. 



98 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

I asked Indira to give a name to the trust. She suggested "Janhit 
Trust." I changed it to "Janhit Nidhi" and told her it was inap- 
propriate to mix Hindi and English. The trust deed drafted by 
C.C. Shah was approved by the Attorney-General. The trust was 
registered early in 1956 with Justice P. N. Sapru, MP, Padmaja 
Naidu and Indira as trustees. 

The first thing done was to get many people to transfer their 
shares and debentures in the Associated Journals Ltd as well as 
their loans to the trust. Prominent among those were Pandit 
Govind Ballabh Pant, K. N. Katju, Sri Prakasa, the Nawab of 
Bhopal, Raja Bhadri, the Maharaja of Gondal, the Maharajkumar 
of Vijayanagaram, Colonel B. H. Zaidi, Ram Ratan Gupta, 
Manubhai Bhimani and the Sarabhais. 

In going through the books of the Associated Journals Ltd I 
found an entry of Rs 200,000 as loan from Feroze Gandhi. On 
enquiry I was told that actually it was an interest-free loan from 
Maharaja Pratap Singh of Baroda. I have referred to this in the 
-chapter "Ran Ahmed Kidwai." When Rafi informed NehTU that 
he had instructed Feroze Gandhi to return the money, he also 
wrote to Feroze Gandhi to carry out the instructions at once; and 
Feroze Gandhi replied after a fortnight that he had returned 
the money. He did nothing of the kind. What he did was to enter 
the amount in the company's books as a loan from himself! Later, 
through Major-General J.K.Bhonsle of the INA and a close friend 
and relative of the Maharaja, I got a letter from the Maharaja 
transferring the loan to the trust, as a donation. Feroze Gandhi, 
who was then out of the Associated Journals Ltd, was not pleased 
about this. 

I was not surprised when one day, during Feroze Ganuhi's 
attacks on Finance Minister T. T. Krishnamachari in parliament, 
Nehru vehemently condemned him in the presence of Lai Bahadur 
and myself and said, "This fellow Feroze is a bloody liar." 
Neither was I surprised when V. K. Krishna Menon once told me, 
■"I have known Feroze Gandhi from his so-called student days in 
London. My experience has led me to the conclusion that he is a 
congenital liar." 

Ramnath Goenka of the Indian Express group of newspapers 
.gave the Associated Journals Ltd a printing press costing about 
Rs 175,000 as gift. 



The "National Herald'' and Allied Papers 99 

Substantial amounts were raised by way of special advertise- 
ments at special rates for the National Herald, Navjivan (Hindi) 
and Quami Awaz (Urdu). Between 1955 and 1957 a total of 
Rs 842,000 was collected through such special advertisements. 
These special advertisements were raised to clear up the vast 
initial mess that the Associated Journals Ltd was in. They came 
from diverse industrial and commercial concerns such as the 
Mafatla! group, the Kasturbhai Lalbhai group, the Tata group, 
the Birla group, the BIC group and several others. 

The receipts in the Janhit Nidhi from its inception in 1956 to 
30 September 1963 were as follows: 

Cash donations Rs 1,577 59^ 

Donations in Kind 

Transfers of loans (later converted into 

ordinary shares) Rs 337,000.00 

Debentures (250) Rs

Total Rs 2,457,933.25

100 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

No significant changes have taken place since, except that the 
cash resources have been spent on the National Herald building in 
Delhi. 

As of 30 September 1963, the capital structure of Associated 
Journals Ltd was that the trust-held stocks and shares in the 
company were worth Rs 1,847,010 as against only Rs 487,450 held 
by the public. 

Even though I did not ask Nehru's permission to take a direct 
but informal interest in the affairs of the National Herald and 
allied papers, I kept him informed of developments. In my final 
report to him at the end of 1957 I informed him that I would take 
no further interest. He called me and said, "You have done a 
great deal to put the affairs of the papers on a sound financial 
basis; but how long will it last? Chalapathi Rau was a good jour- 
nalist during the independence struggle; but somehow he has not 
been able to adjust himself to the new situation after indepen- 
dence. He has little understanding of economic affairs. He is not 
a competent all-round editor. He thinks that by writing long and 
ponderous editorials, which nobody reads, he has produced a 
good paper." Nehru further said, * 'Under Chalapathi Rau's 
editorship the circulation of the paper would never increase. The 
office puts up to me every evening the National Herald, with press 
clippings from papers all over India. I ceased to open the National 
Herald some years ago. I shall not shed a tear if National Herald 
and its allied papers closed down. As I am against the Khadi and 
Village Industries Commission receiving huge grants from govern- 
ment, I am against newspapers requiring spoon-feeding for their 
survival." 

I remember my numerous meetings in London and New Delhi 
with Kingsley Martin, the distinguished editor of the New States' 
man. He was of the firm view that a newspaper or a journal is 
seventy-five per cent business and twenty-five per cent journalism. 
This is what Chalapathi Rau had successfully avoided learning. 



19 Nehru and the Press 



Before entering government Nehru had written several editorials 
and special articles, mostly in his own hand for the National Herald, 
These are now with the National Archives. Photostat copies are 
with the National Herald, 

Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Rajaji and Pantji had their own 
favourites among pressmen; but Nehru never considered it advisa- 
ble to cultivate individual pressmen. 

Nehru considered the Hindu as the best- produced paper in India 
and its reporters the best in the country; but the Hindu was a 
little too conservative for him in regard to economic policy. And 
yet he wanted the Hindu to be put up to him every evening. 

From the middle of the fifties, Nehru considered S. Mulgaokar 
as the most effective journalistic writer in the country. On several 
occasions Mulgaokar had criticized Nehru's policies. And yet, 
when he wanted a high-grade journalist to tone up our foreign and 
domestic publicity, immediately after the Chinese invasion, it was 
to Mulgaokar that Nehru turned. Mulgaokar stipulated certain 
understandable conditions so that his work in government, for a 
temporary period, would be purposeful and effective. The PM 
could not fulfil those conditions in the set-up which existed at that 
time. So the proposal fell through. 

In 1952 Nehru wanted a prominent person with a journalistic 
background as Minister for Information and Broadcasting. .He 
invited B. Shiva Rao to join his Council of Ministers as a minister 
of state with independent charge of the Information and Broadcas- 
ting Ministry. Shiva Rao tried through N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar 
to get Cabinet rank. Nehru was annoyed, gave up the idea, and 
appointed B. V. Keskar instead. 

The one journalist who got on Nehru's nerves was Durga Das. 



1 02 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

He, after a long career in journalism, ended up as special represen- 
tative and later editor of the Hindustan Times. Nehru had heard 
that while he was with the Associated Press of India (an adjunct 
of Reuter), Durga Das was connected with the intelligence set-up 
of the Home Department. Durga Das, who was a favourite with 
Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad and Pantji, tried to get elected to the 
Constituent Assembly from UP. Pantji recommended him; but 
Nehru scored his name out. Durga Das then took up a very hostile 
attitude towards Nehru. He began to write nasty things about Nehru 
and his daughter under the pseudonym INSAF (Justice). It was the 
type of writing intended to hurt. One day Nehru sent for Durga 
Das and talked to him severely. Later, Nehru informed me that he 
had told Durga Das, "You are the meanest man I have met and 
the lowest form of human existence." Normally Nehru wouldn't 
use such strong language. Durga Das was subdued for a while like 
a dog with its tail in a bamboo tube. But when the initial impact 
wore off, Durga Das relapsed into his mean self. One day Nehru 
spotted a very nasty piece and told me, "You might ask Ghanshyam- 
das Birla if this sort of write-up represented his own views." I put 
the question to G.D. Birla, using the PM's own words. G.D. Birla 
told me that he very seldom interfered with the editorial freedom 
of Hindustan Times and added, "I have been noticing Durga Das' 
weekly column INSAF which borders on yellow journalism. I did 
speak to Shim a f€;w times. 1 am going to speak to him again today 
as a last warning. In fact I made up my mind some time ago to get 
rid of Durga Das. That is why I have brought in Mulgaokar." 

The next day Durga Das went to his patron saint, Maulana 
Azad. The Maulana spoke to G.D. Birla who told him that I had 
complained to him and that he might have a word with me. The 
Maulana knew that I was a difficult customer. So he complained to 
the PM. But the PM kept quiet. Soon Durga Das was replaced by 
Mulgaokar. INSAF died a natural death; but out of its ashes arose 
INFA, a weekly newsletter. 

During Nehru's time "keyhole journalism" was not very much 
in evidence, though it seems to be developing fast at present. The 
classic example is a man who has recently published a book on the 
emergency. A friend sent me a copy of the book. In that he has 
referred to me as Nehru's stenographer. I wrote and asked him 
where he got that fantastic information. He did not reply. I made 



Nehru and the Press , A , 

themistake of expecting a modicum of decency in a keyhole jour- 
nalist. I took the trouble of reading through the book. It is a melan- 
choly ptece of work into which so many lies, halftruths innuendoes 
and absurd inventions, ail coated with malice, have been compres- 
sed into a few pages constituting the worst type of journalistic vul- 
garization I have ever seen. It was obviously written to take advan- 
tage of a 'hate wave" in northern India. After finishing the book 
late at mght, it fell from my hands to the floor as I lay in bed The 
next morning my sweepress took the book from the floor and 
asked me, "Sahib, can I have it for my choelaT I felt like telling 

rZn,J* $&gt; r *, A'' 6 iS thirty rUpees; bu * mother for your 
choola. in the style of Samuel Johnson who, when approached by 
a person for a donation of one crown for the burial of a priest, said 
Here are two crowns; bury two." 
In the early years of independence Ramakrishna Dalmia made 

toJK t0 meaSUre , h ! s P itifui st Wh gainst government 
trough the medium of the Times of India and the Illustrated 
Weekly of India which he owned. He singled out Nehru for attacks 
m the most obscurantist manner bringing holy cows and sacred 
monkeys also into the picture. Nehru was naturally annoyed- but 
he did not want to take any vindictive action. He asked me to stop 
subscribing to the Times of India and the Illustrated Weekly as he 
did not wish to render financial support to the gutter press. I, how- 
ever, asked the Press Information Bureau to forward to me such, 
terns from the Times of India and the Illustrated Weekly as were 
libellous. Nothing came from the PIB. Dalmia's foolish adventure 
petered out. However, the Times of India and the Illustrated Weekly 
never again entered the PM's house. 

Around the same time as Dalmia's adventure, Blitz published 
promuicntly on the front page a libellous item against Indira, alleg- 
ing that she took from an unnamed businessman several costly 
sarees. Nehru consulted Kailas Nath Katju. As advised by him a 
notice was sent to the editor of Blitz calling upon him to publish 
prominently on the front page an apology or face legal action. The 
editor considered discretion the better part of valour and complied 
muz never repeated the performance. ' 

While Aneurin Bevan was in India for the first time, he was stay- 
ing in Rajkumari Amrit Kaur's house. There he came across a piece 
of wnting by Frank Moraes attacking Nehru for creating the 
Atomic Energy Department, which he described as a "white- 



^04 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

elephant." Bevan remarked, "This man is said to be one of your top 
journalists." I replied, "Of late he has developed bats in his belfry. 
Goa is a bee in his bonnet; and the Atomic Energy Commission is his 
latest allergy; he cannot see beyond his nose." Bevan recalled that 
fce had had the most determined opposition from the press in push- 
ing through the National Health Service. He added, "A statesman 
-who has rapport with the people need not be unduly perturbed by 
the fulminations in the press. The Almighty did not deposit all the 
wisdom in the press. The greatest thing Nehru is doing in India is 
his massive support for science and technology. This will bring you 
*ich; dividends in the future in terms of economic development and 
social change," 

Nehru was not unaware of the exaggerated claim of the press 
to represent public opinion. When Harry Truman stood for elec- 
tion in 1948 for the American presidency, practically the entire 
press was against him. They claimed to represent public opinion 
and went all out in support of the Republican candidate Dewey. 
Truman confounded everyone and won the election to become "the 
great little President of the United States." 

The London Times editorial of 3 October 1938 on the Munich 
Agreement was a constant reminder to Nehru of the "foresight" 
and "wisdom" of the press! The editorial read: 

The volume of applause for Mr, Chamberlain, which continues 
to grow throughoutthe globe, registers a popular judgment that 
neither politicians nor historians are likely to reverse. One 
fundamental truth that Mr. Chamberlain's daring diplomacy 
brought into the light was this— that even in a totalitarian State 
the people will have their influence in the last resort upon the 
Party. The man who has arrested universal destruction by appea- 
ling to that truth need not fear that in his own country the 
cavillings of Party will outweigh the people's gratitude. But, 
even if there is the inevitable reaction, there must be no retro- 
grade step. Relief from intolerable strain cannot be followed 
by mere relapse into inertia. The lessons-of the crisis are 
plain and urgent. The policy of international appeasement must 
be pressed forward. There must be appeasement not only of the 
strong but of the week— of the State that has allowed itself to 
be weakened for the common good. Czechoslovakia has deser- 
ved well of humanity, and it should be a first international

responsibility not only to guarantee the contracted frontier, but 
also to assist in solving the new problems that the settlement 
has imposed upon her. As between the greater Powers the field 
* for necessary appeasement is wide. 

The editor of the London Times then was Geoffrey Dawson 
who belonged to the disreputable Cliveden Set, the members of 
which met at Cliveden, which was Lord Astor's estate. The 
Cliveden Set was passionately in favour of an understanding with 
the dictators Hitler and Mussolini. The frequent Cliveden social 
functions were greatly enlivened by the two beautiful young 
daughters of Lord Curzon — Lady Ravensdale and the Lady 
Alexandra Metcalfe. The Cliveden Set was bitterly opposed to 
Winston Churchill. 



20 Nehru's Sensitivity to his Surroundings 



Nehru once told me of his working knowledge of the German 
language and how he lost it. When he visited Germany in September 
1935, to be with his ailing wife at Badenweiler two years after 
Hitler had taken over the Reich, the shock of developments in 
Germany was so complete that he forgot the German language 
altogether. However much he tried, he could not utter a word. His 
knowledge never revived. 

On our trip to the United States in October 1948 I took with me 
a sufficient stock of State Express 555 cigarettes to last Nehru for 
the entire period. I did so because I knew that American cigarettes, 
with their toasted tobacco, were too strong for him. At the White 
House I removed all the American cigarettes from his room and 
replaced them with some State Express cigarettes. He saw me 
doing this and got annoyed. He asked me, "Don't you know that 
when I go to a place, I would like to use the things that are locally 
available?" I said, "All right, you try an American cigarette and be 
in tune with your surroundings/' and offered him a Chesterfield, the 
mildest of American cigarettes. He snatched it from me, lighted it 
and began to smoke. After two puffs he started. coughing. I said, 
"Throw it away, I have used American cigarettes- for a number of 
years and I know they are strong. On a trip tike this you have to 
talk endlessly and it is important that you should preserve your 
throat." He looked at me and smiled. He was childlike in many 
ways and sometimes had to be treated as a child. 

Nehru's first visit to the United States was a disaster from the 
point of view of acquiring a favourable impression of the American 
people. To a large extent, some immature, uncouth and arrogant 
American businessmen were responsible for it. At a lunch in New 
York it was mentioned with emphasis in the hearing of Nehru that 
"it is a hundred-dollar lunch." At a dinner in New York by top 



Nehru's Sensitivity to his Surroundings f07 

American businessmen, one of them in his welcome speech declared, 
"Around this table sits one hundred billion dollars." At another 
time Nehru was reminded that the budget of General Motors was 
larger than that of the Government of India. All these "truths" 
jarred on a refined man like Nehru. 

Soon after our return from the United States, I was having break- 
fast with Nehru one morning as he was alone in the PM's house. 
Out of the blue he came out with a statement, "Americans think 
they can buy up countries and continents." I asked him, "Aren't 
you judging a whole nation on the basis of your brief experience of 
some coarse businessmen in New York? I think Americans, on the 
whole, are a warm-hearted and generous people. In your judgment 
of the United States you are no better than the average American 
tourist who spends two weeks in this vast country of ours and writes 
a book about it," Nehru listened, lighted a cigarette and offered me 
one; but I never smoked in his presence. 

Nehru did not normally eat bacon, ham or pork. Denmark is 
famous for its bacon because skimmed milk is fed to the pigs. 
Nehru had heard about this. While we were in Copenhagen, Nehru 
asked me to order bacon and eggs for breakfast. 

On our Japanese tour Nehru had heard that Osaka was famous 
for suckling pigs as an item of food. While in Osaka he ordered it; 
but on that particular day it was not available. Nehru was dis- 
appointed. 

While visiting an oystef farm in Japan, Nehru was persuaded 
by the Japanese Foreign Minister to eat some fresh oysters with a 
strong sauce. It took some persuasion for Nehru to agree. 

While we were in Kobe, I told Nehru that about seventy-five 
years previously the Japanese never ate beef. Now they claimed 
Kobe beef the best in the world, and I asked, "How about ordering 
some for dinner?" He said, "Don't be silly." He knew that I was 
aware that he never ate beef anywhere in the world. 

The grey-haired Japanese Foreign Minister Fujiama arranged a 
small dinner party in a posh restaurant in typical Japanese style 
with Geisha girls in attendance. The party consisted of only four 
persons — Nehru, Fujiama, Secretary-General N. R. Pillafand my- 
self. We sat on mats spread over a quilted floor with a Geisha girl 
on her knees behind each of us. Nehru and I sat on one side, 
Fujiama and Pillai opposite. As is the custom, women are not 
invited to Geisha parties. So, mercifully, Indira was not present. 



* 08 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

Nehru took it all in his stride and allowed himself to be fed by his 
Geisha, and, according, to custom, he did not fail to feed her occa- 
sionally. N. R. PUlai looked as shy as a bride. How he wished to 
exchange places with me because Nehru had to crane his neck to 
look at me! Nevertheless he did so twice and smiled at my activities. 
Nehru refused to touch the rice wine, but had helpings of green 
tea. The Geisha girls were well educated and well trained as hostes- 
ses. 

I once told Nehru, "I think, if you were not Nehru, you would 
perhaps have liked to be a ptarmigan." His curiosity was roused 
and he asked, "What is that?" I told him, "The autumn moult of 
the rock ptarmigan helps to camouflage this ground bird of the 
Tundra and Alpine slopes by giving it a patchwork appearance. 
Brown feathers are replaced by white ones. The winter plumage of 
the ptarmigan is pure white to blend with the snow. The spring 
moulting, triggered perhaps by the change in temperature, will 
produce a brown summer coat, almost all brown." He laughed and 
asked me, "Where do you get all these from?" I told him, "I am a 
sort of naturalist, and Hike to read books on animals and birds, trees 
and plants, mountains and oceans." From then on I lent him many 
of my books on these subjects. He was very careful in handling 
books and returned them promptly. 

Once I got into trouble with Nehru for no fault of mine. From 
Calicut in Kerala he wrote a long note to his Private Secretary on 
27 December 1955 with a copy to me. I reproduce it below: 

I do not know what instructions are sent to places which I visit 
on my tours. Whenever I criticise the food or any arrangement, 
I am told it is strictly according to instructions. The food con- 
sists usually of long many-course meals of the type one normally 
gets in a railway refreshment room. Sometimes the food is fairly 
good, sometimes not. But the main thing is that very elaborate 
arrangements are made for my meals and some hotel or restau- 
rant is put in charge of them. Usually a large group of persons 
from the hotel comes from some other city with a good deal of 
paraphernalia and arranges the long meal. 

2. People have been told that I should have meals after the 
European style and that various kinds of meat are necessary. As 
a matter of fact I usually take only half the meal and even there 
I leave out most of the meats. I am not particularly fond of 



Nehru's Sensitivity to his Surroundings 109 

either meat or of the European style although, if it very good, I 
like it. 

3. When I arrrived in Calicut and reached Krishna Menon's 
house, I found that there was much consternation at the pros- 
pect of my having to be provided with plenty of meats after the 
European style. The house is vegetarian and they were unhappy 
about this. Worse still, the District Magistrate sent four chickens 
to be slaughtered and cooked. The lady of the house was com- 
pletely upset at this idea. Fortunately I came in time to prevent 
this outrage on her sentiment and I asked specially for a Mala- 
yan vegetarian meal, A very good dinner was given to me which 
I enjoyed. 

4. At Nilambur where the local Raja provided our party with 
lunch, this was the first occasion in his life meat entered his house. 
Evidently he disliked the idea, but did not wish to come in the 
way of my presumed tastes. As usual, some hotel had been asked 
to organise the meal and they gave a seven-course affair full of 
heavy meats and fruits which I hardly touched. 

5. I am not a vegetarian, but I do not eat much meat at any 
time and often I do not eat it at all at home. Therefore, there is , 
not only no need for laying stress on meat, but I would much 
rather not have it when I am touring and require light meals, The 
only instruction that should be sent is that I am prepared to eat 
anything provided the meal is a light one and there are no chillies 
or spices in it. On the whole, I would prefer a vegetarian meal 
unless this upsets the party or the hosts. In any event, the meal 
should be a light one. Normally I would like food after the local 
fashion except for the chillies and the spices. 

; 6. When I.am staying in some circuit house, then some outside 
arrangements normally have to be made. They can provide me 
with any food which is convenient, including European food. But 
there should be few courses and the meal should be light. Ela- 
borate hotel arrangements requiring staff to travel about are 
undesirable. 

When he returned to Delhi, Nehru angrily asked me, "Who sent 
the stupid circular?" I said, -Some time ago Padmaja Naidu asked 
me to send a circular to all Raj Bhawans, Chief Ministers and Chief 
Secretaries about what food and fruit juices should be served to you 
She had even put mphalsa juice which i$ unheard of in the south. 



110 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

As I did not like petticoat interferences, I refused and told her that 
nothing should be done about a matter like that unless it had your 
personal approval. She kept quiet. On enquiry I discovered that 
Padmaja imposed herself on one of the Private Secretaries who sent 
a circular, as drafted by her without my knowledge." I told him, 
"On receipt of your note, a new circular was sent to all concerned 
cancelling the old one and incorporating the suggestions contained 
in your note." He said, "Padmaja is good at some things; but she is, 
by no means, a culinary expert in either Indian or European dishes." 

It was the same sensitivity to surroundings that made him make 
a rather unwise statement before his departure from Moscow. After 
a tour of the Soviet Union where he received a tumultuous welcome 
everywhere, he said, "I am leaving a part of my heart behind." It 
was the same thing which prompted him, after his visit to China, to 
encourage the slogan "Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai." 

Soon after the Chinese overran Tibet, Nehru and Krishna Menon 
started talking in public that India and China had lived in peace for 
3,000 years, implying thereby that eternal peace would reign. About 
this time Nehru and Krishna Menon happened to be in my study in 
the PM's house one evening. I told them, "My study of history has 
led me to the inescapable conclusion that in the past whenever 
China was strong, it was expansionist." Nehru frowned and Krishna 
Menon looked glum. I added firmly, "Both of you may live to 
realize this in your lifetime because China is now strong." And they 
did realize it after the treacherous Chinese invasion of India. Then 
Nehru and Menon repeated in public exactly what I had told them 
in the privacy of my study. 

Nehru was not a good judge of situations. After the partition of 
India was decided upon, he visited Lahore in 1947. 1 was with him. 
We stayed in the house of Dewan Ram Lai. At a press conference 
in Lahore, Nehru held forth and asserted that when partition was 
brought about, things would settle down and both contending 
parties would want to maintain peace in their respective areas. 
Most pressmen were sceptical. They asked, "What makes you think 
so?" Nehru replied, "Forty years of public life." We all know what 
happened subsequently. 

After his visit to Spain, he met A.C.N. Nambiar in Europe. 
Nambiar asked Nehru what would be the ultimate outcome of the 
civil war in Spain. Nehru replied that the Republicans would win. 
He then waited for Nambiar 's comments. Nambiar told him bluntly 



Nehru's Sensitivity to his Surroundings HI 

"Like all the Liberals in England, Europe and the United States 
and Krishna Menon, you are indulging in wishful thinking My 
assessment^ is that, much to my dislike, the Republicans have not 
got the ghost of a chance. More blood will flow and Franco will 
emerge as the ruler of Spain." This made Nehru not only annoyed 
but angry. We all know what happened. 

Dr Konrad Adenauer, the late Chancellor of the Federal Republic 
of Germany, whom Winston Churchill once described as the 
greatest German since Bismark, has, in the third volume of his 
Memoirs relating to the period. 1955-59, devoted twenty pages to 
India and Nehru. Among other things, he wrote: . 

Nehru made a good impression on me at our first meeting. He 
was an attentive listener. His own statements were made calmly 
and in polite and low tone. His movements were measured and 
his ways were unobtrusive and restrained. 

Towards the end of the twenty pages, Adenauer stated: 

Nehru did not impress me as a realist. He struck me as being all 
too ready to believe what fitted into his picture of the world 
To let modifications into this picture of his, Nehru manifested 
little disposition. 

Undoubtedly Nehru is a very cultivated person. He is clear 
m the use of words and at formulations. But difficulties of deep 
political issues, he did not estimate rightly. His way of thinking ' 
represented a curious mixture of British and Indian views. This 
led him not to see the realities of politics. 

Adenauer ended up with a quotation from an article by the 
editor of the German periodical Aussenpolitic (Foreign Affairs) 
which underlined the disappointment Nehru felt over the turn in 
China's policy, so very different from the expectations so firmly 
held by Nehru. J 



21 Nehru's Attitude to Money 



When I joined Nehru in Allahabad early in February 1946 I 
discovered that his finances were being looked after by Bachhraj and 
Co., Bombay, a private firm of the late Seta Jatnnalal Bajaj, a close 
associate of GandhijPs and a bussinessman. After a couple of 
months, when I accompanied him to Bombay, Nehru asked me to 
visit Bachhraj and Co. and make a study of his finances. After some 
time, at Nehru's instance, I took over all his assets from Bachhraj 
and Co. His assets consisted of what he inherited from his father 
and what could be salvaged out of the royalties on his books which 
V. K. Krishna Menon mismanaged in the early stages. Krishna 
Menon's jurisdiction was originally limited to the United Kingdom, 
the British Empire (including India) and Europe. There was a 
separate publisher for the United States and Latin America. 

As soon as Nehru accepted office in the interim government on 
2 September 1946, all his assets except his ancestral house and his 
personal bank account were gifted to India. They amounted 
to about Rs 150,000. 

When the book Discovery of India was ready for publication, the 
publication rights for India were taken away from Krishna Menon 
and given to the Indian publisher. The Discovery of India brought 
in good amounts in royalty from everywhere. 
. As and when royalties swelled and savings began to accrue 
Nehru continued to transfer amounts to Indira and, occasionally, 
some as gifts to the Kamala Nehru Memorial Hospital, apart 
from putting in Rs 25,000 each in the names of his two grandsons 
in Government of India Small Savings Certificates. I felt sad that 
Nehru did not make some provision for S. D. Upadhyaya and 
Hari who had served his father and himself for long years on 
mere pittances. 

One day Chairman A. K. Roy of the Central Board of Reve- 



Nehru's Attitude to Money 

mie told me that Nehru could deduct up to fifteen per cent from 
his royalties for secretarial assistance, and that he could claim, 
refund for the past five years-which would be a substantial! 
amount, and then continue the deduction annually

Two days later I spoke to Nehru about A. K. Roy's talk with me 
regarding refimd for the past five years for secretarial assistance on 
the royalty income. I said I had the papers, asking for the refund 
ready for his signature. He was annoyed and said, "I am not going 
to follow the advice of that fathead; I spend no money on score 
tanal assistance; so, why should I claim refund?" I stood my 
ground and quietly told him, "I do all the work in connection with 
the royalties on your books; and I see no reason why I should not 
take the refund due and deductions in subsequent years." Then 1 
placed the papers before him. He kept quite and then said, "in. 
that case I will sign the papers" and he meekly did.

had the peculiar capacity to speak volumes without uttering a 
word. 

Early in the Khrushchev era in the Soviet Union, Ambassador 
Menshikov asked Nehru, at an interview, for permission to publish 
his books in Russian. Nehru agreed. Later he told me about it— for- 
tunately well in time. I asked the Secretary-General of the Ministry 
of External Affairs to tell the Soviet Ambassador that the matter 
had to be finalized with me before he could make any proposals 
to Moscow. The Ambassador promptly came to see me. I told him 
that our practice was to charge fifteen per cent on the sale price as 
royalty and repatriate the royalties to India in rupees periodically 
at our request. The Ambassador agreed to do this as a special gest- 
ure to Nehru. Normally the Soviet Union does not allow royalties 
to be repatriated. The authors concerned can spend the money . 
within the Soviet Union. 

Later, I told Nehru that if other Ambassadors of Communist 
countries asked fiim for similar permission, he might generally 
agree but ask them to fix the details with me. I added that I 
wanted to do business with them on my terms. Thus I had to deal 
with the Ambassadors of China and several East European coun- 
tries. In fact, over a period of years, Nehru received more royal- 
ties from Communist countries than from all the Western countries 
put together. As a consequence, Nehru's gifts to Indira and Kamala 
Nehru Hospital went up and Upadhyaya and Hari and the 
old Anand Bhawan employees continued to receive substantial 
sums from the Employees Welfare Account. 

It might be mentioned here that Indira will continue to live 
largley by her father's pen now that she has ceased to hold office. 
It was amusing and pathetic to see her attempting to put herself 
two steps higher than her father while she was Prime Minister. 
Poor fish! I suppose most women are overburdened by illusions. 

After my resignation from the Prime Minister's office in 1959, 
I was going to Moscow and London for three months in the 
summer of that year. Nehru knew I had no foreign exchange. He 
graciously wrote to Ambassador K. P. S. Menon in Moscow and 
to his literary agent in London asking them to give me as much 
money as I needed or asked for, and forwarded to me copies of 
these. I replied thanking him for his kind gesture and telling him, 
"I have not taken any money from you so far. Both in Moscow 
and London I will be staying with personal friends; I intend 



Kehrtfs Attitude to Money « , - 

to make no purchases; my requirements will be limited to a couple 
of haircuts for which my hosts will gladly pay." I declined to 
-accept his offer. 

While he was Prime Minister, and even before, Nehru never 
asked anyone for money privately even for a good cause. He 
consistently refused to accept any donation in cash from anyone 
for any cause. I am afraid not all his successors followed this prac- 
tice. His technique was public appeal. He would also accept purses 
jpven to him publicly for a political or public cause 

Once Nehru made an exception. After the death of Sir Stafford 
Cnpps a committee in London requested Nehru's assistance 
to collect a token amount in India for a memorial to Cripps. After 
much hesitation and deliberation Nehru wrote to a few people 
including the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Jam Saheb of Nav- 
nagar, for small contributions not exceeding Rs 5,000 in each case 
A sum of about £5,000 was thus collected and remitted to the 
London committee.

j 

Eventually this official came to be called "Private Secretary 
(Public)." 

Nehru was very frugal, to the extent of being parsimonious, 
about spending money on himself. But he did not hesitate for 
a moment to buy a painting "of Gandhiji's in meditation done by 
Mrs Sass Brunner for Rs 5,000. Aneurin Bevan once told me that 
the personality of a man can be judged by how much of his income 
he spent on himself. Bevan, a poor man himself, would buy- 
paintings from struggling artists whenever he could and present 
them to various people. 

Nehru was particular to keep his hands clean in regard to 
money matters; but he did not object to others dirtying their hands. 
to raise funds for the Congress Party or causes in which he was- 
interested. More about this in the next chapter. 

When Nehru died on 27 May 1964, all he left behind was. 
his ancestral house in Allahabad and just enough money in his per- 
sonal bank account to pay his meagre estate duty. 

In matters financial, Nehru had a dread of public opinion. 
In this he was quite different from Sardar Patel. In one instance,. 
Nehru took this dread and fright to a ludicrous extent. I laughed. 
He asked me gravely, "Why are you laughing?" Then I narrated to* 
him a story about public opinion. While Lloyd George was- 
Prime Minister of Great Britain, the British Ambassador in 
Moscow called on the Bolshevik Foreign Minister Chicherin. Tea 
and snacks were served. The British Ambassador started telling 
Chicherin how difficult the position of his Prime Minister was- 
because he had to take into account public opinion in Great 
Britain. He added that in this respect the Soviet Government was in 
a much easier position. Chicherin contradicted the Ambassador and 
said that they in the Soviet Union also had to take public opinion. 
into account in their country. He added, "It all depends how one- 
handles public opinion." At that time a friendly cat of the Kremlin 
walked into the room mewing. Chicherin caught hold of the cat and 
fondled it. He took the honey bottle from the tea table and poured 
some honey into a saucer. Then he handed over the cat to the 
Ambassador asking, "Mr Ambassador, can you make the cat 
drink the honey?" The Ambassador fondled the cat and gently bent 
its head to the saucer. The cat sniffed and turned its head away. In 
triumph tMs Ambassador said, "Ah, that proves my point/*" 
Chicherin smiled and took over the cat and dipped its tail in 



Nehru* s Attitude to Money \yj 

the saucer of honey and let it go. The cat sat there and lapped up 
the honey by licking its tail. Chicherin sat back and told the 
Ambassador, "In most cases public opinion is a convenient excuse. 
There are ways and ways of dealing with public opinion unless you 
want to be its victim." 

Nehru listened with attention and amusement. But he said noth- 
ing. I asked myself, "What can he say?" 



22 G. D. Birla 



Soon after Sardar Patel's death on 15 December 1950 Ghanshyam- 
das Birla rang me up to say he wished to meet me. I received him 
in my study in the Prime Minister's house. It was the first time 
I was seeing him, even though in the past he had been sending 
for the Prime Minister, through me/Alphonso mangoes from 
Bombay and luscious figs from Nasik once, a year and good 
asparagus from his garden in Delhi, occasionally. At the meeting 
he told me that the Finance Ministry was creating difficulties for 
him and his firms inasmuch as his firms were going to be taxed and 
otherwise penalized for the very large donations made to the 
Congress during the freedom struggle over a period of years. This 
was on the basis of the report of the Income Tax Investigation 
Commission appointed by Liaqat AH Khan while he was Finance 
Member in the interim government. He said that Finance Minister 
CD. Deshmukh, with his civil service background under the 
British, had no conception of the circumstances under which. 
these donations were made. Practically all these donations were 
made at the instance of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel. He added that 
he was deeply distressed at the injustice being done. He did not 
know jiow to proceed in the matter. He said his relationship with. 
Pandit Nehru was never close and that there was always a 
distance between them. I told him that Pandit Nehru was never 
associated with fund collections for the Congress and that, instead 
of approaching him directly, he might meet Maul ana Azad and 
explain the situation to him. I added that I felt sure that Mauiana 
Azad would speak to the Prime Minister. In the meantime I 
mentioned to the Prime Minister about G. D. Birla's meeting with: 
me and what transpired. 

G. D. Birla did as I asked him. Subsequently, Mauiana Azad 
spoke to the Prime Minister; and the PM sent for G. D. Birla and 



&lt;7. D. Birla U9 

had a talk with him. Incidentally, whenever G. D. Birla asked for 
interviews, the PM invariably met him at the PM's house in the 
mornings, before leaving for office. After the meeting with Birla 
some correspondence took place between the PM and Finance 
Minister Deshmukh. The latter took a rather rigid attitude 
initially. The PM made it clear to Deshmukh that donations given 
to the Congress before independence should not be treated as 
donations to a political party but to a national movement engaged 
in the freedom struggle against a foreign power. The, PM made it 
clear that he would not like to be a party to penalize people who 
took risks in helping the freedom struggle. The Finance Minister 
at last agreed to do the right thing. Later, the PM told me that I 
might verbally inform G.D. Birla about the outcome. 

One day, soon after, G.D. Birla had a long talk with me. Among 
other things, he said, "I was considerably influenced by Gandhiji's 
trusteeship theory. Before independence I divested myself of all 
my assets. Some was distributed to my children, but most of it 
went to public charitable trusts such as the Birla Education Trust 
which runs the Institute of Technology at Pilani. All I get now is 
Rs 5,000 per month, free of income tax from Birla Brothers 
(Private) Ltd." I commented, "There is talk of government introduc- 
ing wealth tax and estate duty in the future; then you won't be 
affected by them as you are as free from assets as a frog is from 
feathers." He admitted it would be so. 

One day Nehru related to me an encounter G. D. Birla had 
with him in the winter of 1925. Nehru had written to Gandhiji 
and said that he was unhappy about being a financial burden on 
his father and wanted to stand on his own feet. The difficulty 
was that he was a wholetime worker of the Congress. Gandhiji, 
in his reply dated 15 September 1924, wrote, "Shall I arrange for 
some money for you? Why may you not take up remunerative 
work? After all you must live by the sweat of your brow even 
though you may be under Father's roof. Will you be correspon- 
dent to some newspapers? Or will you take up a professorship?" 

On 30 September 1925 Gandhiji again wrote, "I would not hesitate 
to ask a friend or friends who would consider it a privilege to 
pay you for your public services. I would press you to take it 
from public funds if your wants, owing to the situation in which 
you are and must be, were not extraordinary. I am myself convin- 
ced that you should contribute to the common purse either by 



120 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

doing some business or by letting your personal friends find funds for 
retaining your services. There is no immediate hurry, but without 
fretting about it come to a final decision. I will not mind even if 
you decided to do some business. I am sure that Father will not 
mind any decision you may arrive at so long as it gives you 
•complete peace." (Gandhiji had not realized the extent of the pride 
•of the Father and the Son.) 

Obviously, Gandhiji mentioned the matter to G. D. Birla who 
turned up at Allahabad. With great diffidence G.D. Birla spoke to 
Nehru and offered to make adequate arrangements in whatever 
manner Nehru liked. Nehru succeeded in suppressing his annoy- 
ance, but gently declined the offer. 

G. D. Birla and his close relatives were generous to Rajkumari 
Amrit Kaur for a project sh&lt;* had sponsored and with which I 
subsequently associated myself with Nehru's knowledge. Ulti- 
mately this brought trouble to me. About this I shall write separa- 
tely. 

Nehru once told me what he thought of G. D. Birla. He said, 
"Ghanshyamdas Birla is a curious combination of a buccaneer in 
his early days and a very generous man." 

Early in 1955, G, D, Birla had a long talk with me. He said 
that Gandhiji and Sardar Patel made use of him in several ways. 
He added, "The second general elections are to be held this 
winter. For the first general elections the AICC had some funds 
left behind by Sardar Patel. I shall be happy to help in the 
collection of a central fund from prominent industrialists if 
Panditji welcomes it." I told him that it was not very desirable to 
bring Panditji directly into the picture. I said I would discuss this 
matter with a few people and also mention it to the PM and then 
get into touch with him. I called a meeting attended by T.T. 
Krishnamachari, Lai Bahadur and U. S. Malliah. I told them of 
G.D.Birla's talk with me and that I had appraised the PM of it. 
I said we should give a target to G. D. Birla for the central fund, 
taking into account the fact that the Provincial Congress Com- 
mittees would be collecting money from all except the big indus- 
trialists. The consensus at the meeting was that a target of ten 
million rupees for the Congress Central Election Fund should be 
aimed at. , 

Another meeting of the same persons was subsequently held at 
T. T. Krishnamachari's residence with G, D. Birla also present. 



&lt;G.D. Birla 12 I 

Birla said that the target was not impossible to achieve. He 
suggested that a separate bank account should be opened in the 
name of the PM. G. D. Birla was asked to go ahead with the 
■ collection anticipating the PM's acquiescence. 

I arranged for T.T. Krishnamachari, Lai Bahadur and Malliah 

-to meet theTM in my presence. The PM had already learnt from 

' m e what had happened till then. T. T. Krishnamachari suggested 

that the PM might agree to open a separate bank account in his 

name. I intervened and said that even the PM needed protection and 

•that the account should be in the names of two persons. I suggested 

-the name of Morarji Desai, who then happened to be the Treasurer 

■of the Indian National Congress. The PM approved; but T.T. 

Krishnamachari was later annoyed with me because he never had 

.any use for Morarji. 

The collections for the Congress Central Election Fund exceeded 
the target by Rs 2,500,000. 

On return from one of his rare visits to Anand Bhawan, 
Allahabad, I found Nehru glum and irritable. I asked Indira, 
"'What is biting the 'old man*?" She told me that when the AICC 
-shifted from Swaraj Bhawan to Delhi, the building was left in a 
•shockingly dilapidated condition, and that her father was deeply 
; hurt by the callousness of the AICC authorities; he did not know 
liow to get the extensive reconstruction, restoration and repairs done 
;and where the money was to come from. The building was to be 
used as the Children's National Institute of which Mrs Shyam 
Kumari Khan was Director. 

I spoke to G.D. Birla and told him that something should be 
•done to restore the building steeped in history. He immediately 
wrote out a cheque for Rs 100,000 from one of his trusts in favour 
of the Swaraj Bhawan Trust and sent it to the PM for his accept- 
ance. Nehru was pleased and informed B, C. Roy, who was a 
trustee of the Swaraj Bhawan Trust. The cheque was forwarded to 
Shyam Kumari Khan. G.D. Birla also got a cheque for Rs 25,000 
from one of the trusts of Kasturbhai Lalbhai for the same pur- 
pose. 

In the meantime, I had asked Shyam Kumari Khan to get a 
good architect to make an estimate for a thorough renovation of 
Swaraj Bhawan. Without delay Shyam Kumari Khan sent me the 
detailed report and estimate of the expenditure of about Rs 200,000. 
I placed them before the PM. 



J *~ Reminiscences of the Nehru Age- 

I mentioned to G. D. Birla that the estimate was for about 
Rs 200,000. Without a moment's hesitation he wrote out another 
cheque from his trust for Rs 100,000 in favour of the Swaraj 
Bhawan Trust and sent it to the PM. Nehru returned the cheque- 
to G. D. Birla saying that he was very annoyed with me for 
troubling him so muchi Since Nehru's attitude was negative and he- 
had no alternative plan to raise funds, I decided to circumvent him. 
On my advice, G. D. Birla tore up the cheque and wrote out 
another, for the same amount, in favour of the,Children's National. 
Institute, I forwarded it to Shyam Kumari Khan with instruc- 
tions that the amount was to be used exclusively for the restora- 
tion and renovation of Swaraj Bhawan, Three months later Nehru 
was told of my action. He kept quiet; probably he thought that 
scolding would not have much effect on me in a matter like this. 

I would like to place on record that as long as I was officially- 
connected with the PM. G. D. Birla never asked me for any 
Tavour, big or small. He is too big a man to do any such thing. 

After a visit to the Institute of Technology at Pilani, the 
British statesman, Aneurin Bevan, told me, "Jt is a firstrate insti- 
tution built up by an imaginative and big-hearted man.*' Ambassador 
A.C.N. Nambiar, who lived in Europe continuously for fifty-five 
years and knows much about European universities, particularly in. 
West Germany, France, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and Sweden, 
told me, after a couple of visits to his niece, who was Dean of 
Humanities at Pilani, that the Birla Institute of Technology at 
Pilani in many ways compares very favourably with similar 
institutions in Europe. 

It has been a fashion with secondrate politicians to howl 
against the so-called big businessmen and industrialists. Some of 
these men, who have been builders of this country and not slogan- 
mongers, are bigger than most of the howling politicians put 
together. If any of them has done irregular things, let the govern- 
ment penalize them. Why howl? 

From 1952 onwards G. D. Birla had been sending to Nehru on 
his birthdays a sum calculated at Rs 1,000 per year of his age plus- 
one rupee to be spent at his discretion. These cheques were 
invariably credited to the account called Distress Relief Fund from 
which innumerable struggling students, widows, and people do 
distress have received succour. 



23 Nehru and Alcoholic Drinks 



Very many people have asked me if Nehru drank. My invariable 
answer is, "Yes— water." But he was never an intolerant puritan 
like Morarji Desai. 

The only time I have seen him sip a drink was at the mountain 
resort, Burgenstok, in Switzerland. We had gone there from 
London for a conference of heads of Indian missions in Europe. 
At the instance of Lady Mountbatten, Nehru had invited Charlie 
Chaplin to come up from fcis place, Vevy, to Burgenstok for a 
couple of days. Nehru had told me in advance that I should be 
with Charlie Chaplin whenever he himself was otherwise engaged. 
Charlie Chaplin was Nehru's guest at the hotel where we stayed. 
This gave me a welcome chance of avoiding the conference of 
pompous Ambassadors. 

Charlie Chaplin had then only recently settled down in 
Switzerland, having left the United States where he haa some 
bitter experiences, personal and political. He never became a 
naturalized American citizen and jealously kept his British pass- 
port. He spoke to me frankly about his experiences in the United 
States. He was bitter but spoke very highly of Franklin Roosevelt. 
For all the rest, including Eisenhower who was then President of 
Columbia University and a prospective President of the United 
States after Truman, he had only unmitigated contempt. He spoke 
very warmly about Greta Garbo and told me about kissing her 
knees after asking her permission. I told him that I saw Greta 
Garbo at the Waldrof Astoria hotel in New York, standing in a 
queue to have a look at Nehru as he passed by. Charlie Chaplin 
said, "She would not do such a thing to a mere head of govern- 
ment," and added, "to her and to many of us Nehru is much more 
than the Prime Minister of India." 

Charlie Chaplin's way of talking and gesturing were very 



124 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

feminine and endearing. During his two days in Burgenstok I 
-spent several delightful hours with him. 

One evening Charlie Chaplin and I were sitting in a quiet corner 
-of the hotel lounge, sipping sherry. Just then Nehru walked in and 
rsat down with us. Charlie Chaplin asked him to have a sherry with 
us. Nehru told him that he did not drink and that he did not like 
the taste of any alcoholic drink. Like a woman Charlie Chaplin 
-charmingly persisted and at last ordered a glass of sherry. In order 
not to offend Charlie Chaplin, Nehru took a sip, contorted his 
face, and put it away. 

On our way back to Geneva by car, Charlie Chaplin travelled 
-with Nehru who halted at Vevy on Lake Geneva to have lunch 
"with him and his wife Oona whom Charlie was never tired of 
referring to as the luminous beauty. Throughout the journey 
Charlie Chaplin was on tenter-hooks. He was frightened of motor 
travel on mountain roads. 

During Nehru's visit to Germany, he had to give a return 
banquet to Chancellor Adenauer and his principal colleagues. 
Ambassador Nambiar wanted to serve drinks. He spoke to Secret- 
ary-General N. R. Pillai. They both came to me and asked me to 
-do something about it. I spoke to Nehru who flatly refused at 
my first attempt. I persisted and told him, "We are not in India; 
do you want to be a Morarji and impose prohibition on foreigners 
in their own country? They are used to drinks and it would be 
intolerance to deny them here. The Indians present can abstain 
from drinking." He thought for a moment and said, "All right, 
tell Nanu he can serve sherry to begin with and Moselle wine 
&lt;white) and Rhine wine (red) and nothing else. He and N.R. 
Pillai should abstain from drinking." This was done even though 
~N. R. Pillai was annoyed at the decision. 

In Delhi Nehru used to put up important foreign dignitaries in 
the Prime Minister's house. I can remember Aneurin Bevan, 
Selwyn Lloyd, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan staying in the 
Prime Minister's house. During their stay, bottles containing 
^alcoholic drinks of various kinds were placed in their rooms for 
their use by the Protocol Division of the Ministry of External 
Affairs. An English-speaking servant was put on duty to serve 
them drinks whenever they wanted. But no drinks were served at 
^Nehru's dining table. 

Early in 1955 Ambassador K.P.S. Menon sent me a rather 



Nehru and Alcoholic Drinks 125 

diffident letter about serving alcoholic drinks during Nehru's 
impending visit to the Soviet Union. I put it up to the Prime: 
Minister who sent me a note which I reproduce below: 

Prime Minister's Secretariat 

So far as K.P.S. Menon's letter is concerned, you might make- 
it clear to him that in any party given by us, big or small, no 
alcoholic drinks will be served* I am sorry if this upsets the: 
Russians, but they should know how we function. The only- 
exceptions may be as follows: 

At the small dinner to Government members, the Russians may- 
be served some sherry or light wine or vodka. No champagne to- 
anybody. No Indian present will be served or accept any- 
alcoholic drinks. 

At the reception, no alcoholic drinks of any kind. You may tell' 
him that this was the rule we adopted in China. In fact there- 
were no exceptions at all in regard to alcoholic drinks. We had. 
previously informed the Chinese Government that I did not. 
drink and that we did not serve them. If K.P.S. Menon likes, he? 
may give this information to the Russians previously. 



24 Sarojini Naidu 



I met her first in 1946 in Delhi. She was a short woman with the 
wide mouth of a frog. She had heard about me from her daughters 
Padmaja and Leilamani, She took kindly to me. I have never seen 
a woman so full of innate authority as Sarojini; and perhaps there 
never existed such an elderly woman so fond of sweets and rich 
food as she was. She was a wholly liberated woman, full of under- 
standing and sympathy for others. When her younger sister and 
her husband Nanu (A. C. N. Nambiar) fell out and separated 
Sarojim's sympathies were all for Nanu. She took his side against 
her own sister. 

Under the influence of Gandhiji, Sarojini reluctantly issued a 
statement mildly, critical of her famous brother, Chatto (Virendra- 
nath Chattopadhyaya), about his terrorist activities. This infuria- 
ted her father, Aghornath Chattopadhyaya, who refused to see her 
ever again. When he was on his deathbed, Sarojini arrived at his 
house to have a last glimpse of him. The old man refused her 
permission. This remained with her, throughout her life, as a 
matter of great personal sorrow. 

Sarojini, her son Jayasooriya and daughters Padmaja and Leila- 
mam, were the products of the composite culture of Hyderabad 
city. They were absolutely noncommunal; in fact a little too pro- 
Muslim. They had contempt for the Andhra Reddys. They were 
Nawabi in their outlook. Sarojini had a soft corner for the Indian 
princes of the north, particularly a few Muslim ones. She revelled 
in holding court and in gossip. She liked courtiers like K M 
Pamkkar to surround her and sing her praises. She had no use for 
socialism, loved the good things of life, and was a great liberal. 

In 1946, when Nehru became Congress President, Gandhiji 
adv.sed him not to include Sarojini in the Working Committee as 
he was expecting important negotiations with the British and 



Sarojini Naidu 127 

feared that she would talk loosely and leak out secrets. Nehru 
replaced her by Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya. Sarojini was furious 
for some time. 

When independence came, Sarojini was the obvious choice for 
the woman's seat in the Cabinet; but she was considered too old 
and was sent as the UP Governor. She was a wonderfully good 
-Governor; but, alas, her tenure was cut short by her sad demise. 

I accompanied Nehru to Lucknow on one of his brief visits. I 
was struck by the care and affection she bestowed on Nehru's old 
personal servant Hari. Accompanied by her ADC she visited Hari's 
room, herself carrying a large plate of sweets, with the ADC follow- 
ing with a bowl of fruits, and placed them in Hari's room. No 
-Governor but Sarojini would have done this. She was too big a 
person not to do it. 

Poetess and orator, motherly and natural in her behaviour, 
Sarojini Naidu, hailed as the Nightingale of India, was perhaps 
the most gifted, the most accomplished and one of the greatest 
women this country has produced in the past few centuries. 



25 Rajkumari Amrit Kaur 



Bora in the princely family of Kapurthala in 1887, Rajkumarx 
Amrit Kaur was the only girl among six brothers. She had her 
schooling in England. After passing her Senior Cambridge exami- 
nation, she wanted to go to Oxford; but her mother stood in the- 
way. So she had to come back and to content with piano-play ing, 
some household chores, and tennis, at which she was very good,, 
and had won many trophies in. 

Rajkumari told me once that in her time as a young girl Xh&amp; 
three outstanding beauties in India were Indi Cooch-Behar, Tai 
Rajwade and herself. She fell in love with an Englishman; but her 
parents, particularly her mother, refused to entertain the idea of 
her marriage to a foreigner. 

Progressively, Rajkumari came into conflict with her mother. 
Her father, though unhappy at the development, chose to keep* 
quiet. Her eldest brother was sympathetic to her and occasionally- 
indulged in threatening the mother. That was not of much help, 
The brother who stood by her was Lieutenant- Colonel Kanwar 
Shumshere Singh, one of the earliest Indian IMS officers. Rajkumarf 
left her home and stayed with Kanwar Shumshere Singh for whom 
she developed a lifelong affection and devotion. She did not return 
to her ancestral home in Simla until after her mother died. Then, 
she joined her father and functioned as his hostess. Viceroys and* 
Governors and other dignitaries were guests at her father's house. 

Rajkumari once told me that in her life she hated only one- 
person. I asked her who the person was. She said, "My mother,'*' 
and proceeded to use the choicest epithets against her. 

Rajkumari took a great deal of interest in the All India Women's- 
Conference which was an active organization during British times. 
Early in life she showed her capacity to raise funds for good causes. 
She was one of the founders of Lady Irwin College in New Delhi 



Rajkumari Amrit Kaur 129 

and considerably helped in building up that institution. 

It was in the middle of the thirties that Rajkumari Amrit Kaur 
joined Gandhiji as one of his Secretaries. Prior to that she was in 
correspondence with Gandhiji and did some work for him in Simla 
and adjoining areas in the field of khadi and village industries. In 
1959 the Rajkumari told me that everyone in her family including 
her beloved brother and protector Kanwar Shumshere Singh, dis- 
approved of her association with Gandhiji, leave alone staying in his 
primitive hut in Sevagram. Kanwar Shumshere Singh soon relented 
and became reconciled to it. In fact he even became the unofficial 
medical adviser to Gandhiji in so far as his writings on health 
subjects were concerned. 

The actual period of time that the Rajkumari spent with Gandhiji 
was limited because she was sent out on errands by him and also 
to look after his interests in the Simla region. Then came Gandhiji's 
arrest and imprisonment in 1942. During the Quit India movement 
the Rajkumari was imprisoned in the Punjab. This was her first 
jail experience. She told me she did not like it, mainly because of 
the rats, and lizards on the walls. She feared and detested both. 
Her jail term was short. She was released by the authorities on 
their own initiative. On Gandhiji's release, she joined him and was 
mostly with him until she became a Cabinet Minister on 15 August 
1947. 

The Rajkumari was not Nehru's first choice as the woman 
minister in his Cabinet. His choice was Hansa Mehta. Nehru had 
earmarked the Rajkumari for assignment as a Governor or Ambas- 
sador. However, Gandhiji intervened and pleaded for the Raj- 
kumari and Nehru fell in line. 

Her ten-year tenure as Union Health Minister marked the con- 
trol and eradication of the scourge of malaria in the country and 
the establishment of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. 
As minister, the Rajkumari was a little too much in the hands of 
her civil servants and her medical administrators. On more than 
one occasion in the Cabinet she could not adequately explain her 
ministry's proposals under consideration by the Cabinet. On being 
cross-examined by her Cabinet colleagues, she burst into tears. The 
consideration of the matter was postponed and at the next meeting 
of the Cabinet, the Secretary of her Ministry and the Director- 
General of Health Services had to be summoned to properly 
explain the proposals to the Cabinet. 



130 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

The two most elegant Indian women I have met were Rajkumari 
Amrit Kaur and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. Theirs was an elegance 
which was simple in person, clothes and general turnout in contrast 
to the rather vulgar display by most Maharanis. 

The Rajkumari was good at making brief, pretty speeches. More 
than the contents of the speech, her melodious and rich voice made 
people listen to her with attention. Where a reasoned speech on a 
specific subject was called for, or in a debate, she cut a sorry figure. 
As a writer she was poor. I once asked A.C.N. Nambiar, who knows 
French well, about the Rajkumari's command of spoken French. 
His reply was, "She is bold." 

As a Congress minister, the Rajkumari indulged in talking ill of 
Congressmen. Congress MPs resented this. She fraternized with 
opposition MPs, particularly Communists. She liked being invited 
by Ambassadors and also entertaining them in her own house. It 
washer practice to speak to Ambassadors in disparaging terms about 
the Congress. It did not occur to her that it was unworthy of a 
Congress minister to do so. Once she wrote to Prime Minister Nehru 
assailing Congressmen and ended up by saying, "Congressmen 
are rogues and rascals; they are all for themselves and devil take 
the hindmost." Nehru was more amused than annoyed. He replied 
to her, "Thank you for the compliment; I am also a Congressman." 
This reminded me of an American woman Ambassador's visit to 
Pope Pius XI. She was one of the most beautiful women of her day 
with an acid and loose tongue, and was a recent convert to Catho- 
licism. She held forth about what the Catholic religion stood for 
and what was expected of the faithful. She exhibited all the zeal 
of a new convert. The austere Pope listened in silence to the 
long harangue and quietly dismissed her with one sentence, "But, 
Madame Ambassador, I am also a Catholic." 

Once, at a conference of eminent medical men in Bangalore, the 
Rajkumari spoke about family planning and said that the rhythm 
method was the nearest to Gandhiji's ideas on the subject. She 
warmed up and added, "I can tell you from experience that the 
rhythm method is most effective." Coming from a spinster it was 
too much for the distinguished audience; but they controlled them- 
selves from bursting into laughter. What the Rajkumari really 
meant was "medical experience" and not her personal experience! 

Once, the Rajkumari told me, not without girlish giggles, about 
a wealthy, elderly, distinguished, non.career High Commissioner 



Rajkumari Amrit Kaur J32 

proposing to her in her late sixties. She was particularly amused at 
the words he used, "Oh Amrit, won't you come and share, my 
loneliness?" Poor fellow, had to live out his loneliness all by 
himself! 

In the 1961-62 general elections, the Rajkumari wanted to stand 
for re-election to Lok Sabha from the Jullundur constituency. 
Swaran Singh had earlier asked for it. The Rajkumari's own con- 
stituency was Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. The Congress Central 
Election Committee favoured Swaran Singh for Jullundur. It was 
suggested that the Rajkumari might stand from Mandi; as an alter- 
native the committee offered Kaithal in the Punjab which was a 
safe constituency. In her obstinacy, the Rajkumari said, "Jullundur 
or nothing." So she got nothing. This made her bitter. She was 
further embittered when she was not included in the Cabinet in 
1962. When she ceased to be a Cabinet Minister, she had to shift 
from the spacious bungalow, 2 President's Estate. The government 
allotted her a smaller house on Akbar Road. Two days before shift- 
ing, I suggested to the Prime Minister that the Rajkumari might be 
allowed to stay on at 2 President's Estate. After all she was Chair- 
man of the Red Cross, T. B. Association, Leprosy Association and 
Chairman of the Governing Council of the AH India Institute of 
Medical Sciences which was a government institution. On the PM's 
recommendation the President reailotted 2 President's Estate to the 
Rajkumari on a rent of Rs 500 per month, inclusive of electricity 
and water supply. The Rajkumari was pleased and was grateful 
to me. 

Soon after the Rajkumari ceased to be a Cabinet Minister, Nehru 
offered her the governorship of Madhya Pradesh, but she declined 
the offer. 

When I left the PM's house in 1959.,! the Rajkumari asked me to 
stay in hers. I did so for a week. When I discovered that she would 
not accept payment for my food and other personal items, I left 
and stayed with a friend who was an MP. Two years later, the 
Rajkumari asked me to shift to her house and reluctantly agreed 
to accept payment. So I shifted. Some time later she told me that 
I should stay on until her death or that of her elder brother Kanwar 
Shumshere Singh, whichever came last. 

The Rajkumari was somewhat overwhelming to the second 
generation of her family. Her attitude to her own sex was unfriend- 
ly and forbidding, but when one was in trouble, she would go all 



j 32 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

out to help the person, regardless of who It was. 

In 1962 the Rajkumari wanted to revise her will to make a 
substantial bequest to me. I prevented her from doing so. Then 
she decided to build a bungalow in the grounds of the All India 
Institute of Medical Sciences on condition that she, her brother, 
and I could stay there during our respective lifetimes, after which 
it would become the property of the AIIMS. I now rather regret 
that I advised her against it. She and her brother also accepted my 
advice to gift her palatial house in Simla to the Government of 
India. This was done in 1963, and the President of India, with the 
concurrence of the Prime Minister, placed 2 President's Estate at 
their disposal free of rent for their respective' lifetimes. But alas, 
the Rajkumari died the following year; but her brother lived till the 
middle of 1975, reaching the age of ninety-six. I remained with him 
tilt the end, thus fulfilling a promise I had made to the Rajkumari. 

The Rajkumari mothered me a great deal. I have the pleasan- 
test memories of this wonderful and courageous woman. 



26 Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit 



Born with the century, Swamp, as she was christened, was one of 
the most beautiful women of her day. As was the practice among 
Kashmiri Brahmans, she took on the name of Vijaya Lakshmi on 
her marriage. To Nehru and close relatives and friends she was 
Nan. 

She loved the good things of life, was a gourmet in her younger 
days and an excellent cook. Like her father and brother, she 
looked elegant in whatever she wore. It was a joy to look at 
this petit and elegant woman. Even in her old age she is attractive 
though she has neglected herself in recent years. She was generous 
and unfortunately extravagant. This brought her trouble later on. 

In the Nehru family only Jawaharlal and Motilal made deliberate 
decisions to give up the life of comfort and adopt austerity when 
they threw themselves into the national struggle. All the rest, 
including Vijaya Lakshmi, were swept off their feet by force of 
events. Adjustments were not easy. 

Vijaya Lakshmi spent 1945 and part of 1946 in the United States 
where she did good work for the cause of Indian independence 
countering the propaganda of the British and their stooge Girja 
Shankar Bajpai. Appropriately, she was present in San Francisco 
at the birth of the United Nations as an observer. 

In 1947 Vijaya Lakshmi was pulled out of the UP Cabinet and 
senfas Ambassador to tJie Soviet Union/ a singularly^ wrong place 
for her temperament. She did not have the capacity as her succes- 
sor Radhakrishnan had, for philosophical detachment. In the 
bleak atmosphere of Moscow of the Stalinist era, with its awesome 
rigidity and regimentation, she was a square peg in a round hole. 
Even Nehru was then considered in the Soviet Union as a running 
dog of imperialism! Her tenure in Moscow was short and she was 
transferred as Ambassador to Washington. She told me that her 



134 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

tenure in Moscow was a moral defeat but its end was a relief. 

Washington society suited her. She revelled in it and loved 
holding court, entertaining and being entertained. Extravagance 
reached the highest pitch. Without permission she withdrew money 
from Nehru's royalty account with his American publisher. I had 
to write to the publisher prohibiting him from disbursing any 
amount from Nehru's royalty account to anyone in future without 
the written permission of Nehru or myself. 

From 1946 onwards, until she was elected as President of the 
United Nations General Assembly in 1953, with one interruption, 
she led the Indian delegations to the UN General Assembly with 
distinction. After 1953 Krishna Menon took over from her. 

Vijaya Lakshmi used to be a temperamental person and had the 
habit of cancelling appointments at the last moment. She once did 
this to Henry Cabot Lodge at the UN. He was naturally annoyed 
and sent her a message, "There are Brahmans in Boston also." 
The old New England families in Boston are called "Boston Brah- 
mans." Cabot Lodge came from a noted family in Boston. 

Soon after Gandhiji's assassination a sealed file kept by Gandhiji 
was delivered to Nehru by Rajkumari Amrit Kaur. Nehru opened 
the file and, after a cursory perusal of the papers, called me and said, 
"These are the papers about young Vijaya Lakshmi's elopement 
with Syed Hussain. You had better burn them." I pleaded with him 
to let me keep them in my archives; but he was not in favour of it. 
I took the file from him and went straight to the kitchen in the 
PM's house and stood there until the papers were reduced to ashes. 

Vijaya Lakshmi had the great gift of being extremely charming 
when a visitor was face to face with her and being extremely nasty 
after the visitor had departed. Perhaps it is part of the diplomatic 
process. 

I was not unaware of Vijaya Lakshmi's criticism against me, that 
I was building up Indira against her. The fact is that I built up 
nobody against anybody. 

After her tenure in Washington, Vijaya Lakshmi returned to 
India early in 1952 and was elected to the Lok Sabha. She hoped 
to become a Cabinet Minister. But Nehru did not consider it 
appropriate, under normal circumstances, to have his sister in his 
Cabinet. Her election as President of the UN General Assembly 
in 1953 came as a recompense. When Vijaya Lakshmi became an 
MP, the PM asked me to speak to the Works Minister to allot her 



Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit 1 3 5 

a bungalow in New Delhi. I said it would lead to criticism. I 
suggested to the PM that the Works Minister might be asked to 
set apart a few bungalows for MPs who have been Cabinet 
Ministers, Governors or heads of missions abroad, as well as for 
leaders of opposition groups in both Houses of parliament. Nehru 
liked the idea and wrote to the Works Minister. Thus Vijaya 
Lakshmi got a bungalow without exposing herself or the PM to 
criticism. 

In parliament Vijaya Lakshmi started getting frustrated. Secre- 
tary-General N. R. Pillai, of the Ministry of External Affairs, 
persuaded her, in consultation with me, to go to London as High 
Commissioner in succession to B. G. Kher. So off she went. As 
High Commissioner she created a good impression.

140 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

asking for the loan of a substantial sum. Her letter gave the 
astounding reason, of the failure of the Government of India to 
remit her salary and emoluments on time owing to foreign exchange 
shortage, for soliciting the loan. Grady stated that he failed to get 
back the money from Vijaya Lakshmi despite repeated requests. 
So he asked Ambassador Mehta for his help in getting the money 
back. The PM was astonished and wrote to Vijaya Lakshmi in 
London asking her to make early payment of the debt. 

In the second half of 1954 the Chairman of the Income Tax 
Investigation Commission privately informed the PM that there 
were entries in the account books of two large Birla concerns of 
substantial sums of money having been paid to Vijaya Lakshmi. 
The PM asked me to get into touch with G.D. Birla and get confir- 
mation, I was reluctant to get involved in this. However, I had to do 
as I was told. G. D. Birla confirmed the report. He said, "There is 
only one national leader who has not taken any money from us, 
and that is Pandit ji. All others, including Mrs Pandit, have." He 
reeled out all the important names— from Gandhiji and Sardar 
Patel downwards. He added that Jayaprakash Narayan was shown 
as his Private Secretary in the books of Birla Brothers and was paid 
a monthly salary for long years until the assassination of Gandhiji. 
Because of Jayaprakash Narayan's attacks on him in connection 
with Gandhiji's assassination, Sardar Patel had asked Birla to stop 
further payments to Jayaprakash Narayan. G. D. Birla requested 
me to ascertain from the PM if he should resume payments to 
Jayaprakash Narayan. I said, "The PM is not the man to be 
consulted in a matter like this. You should take your own decision. 
If I were you, I would not only start paying him but also give him 
a lump sum to compensate him for the period for which payments 
were cut off." 

I reported G. D. Birla's confirmation to the PM. He wrote to 
Mrs Pandit in London enquiring about the matter. She replied 
defying everything. Tile PM askeld me if I could get aiiy receipts 
from G. D. Birla. So I reluctantly contacted him again. He said 
that for any amounts paid in India in rupees there may not be 
receipts; but for amounts drawn in dollars by Vijaya Lakshmi or 
anyone on her behalf from the agent of Birlas in New York there 
would be receipts. He asked me, "Is this not an unprofitable 
exercise?" However, he asked his younger brother, B. M. Birla, to 



Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit 141 

obtain the receipts from New York. The latter got the photostats 
of the receipts and I showed them to the PM. 

I told the PM that it served little purpose to worry about the 
matter any more and that the melancholy chapter might be closed. 

On return from her tenure in London, she was sent as Governor 
of Bombay. In 1962 she hoped that she would be selected as the 
candidate for Vice-Presidentship in place of Radhakrishnan; but 
Nehru had other ideas. He brought in Zakir Husain. 

Some time after Nehru's death, Vijaya Lakshmi wrote to me 
from Poona to ask if I could visit her for a few days as she wished 
to discuss her future with me. I went. She told me that she would 
like to stand for election to Lok Sabha from Nehru's constituency 
in the by-election, but that Indira was dead set against it. Lai 
Bahadur and Kamaraj were not opposed and she felt that finally 
she would get the Congress ticket. She asked for my opinion. I told 
her that she should enter active politics only if she was mentally 
reconciled to being only an MP because, with Indira in the Cabinet, 
there was not the slightest chance of a second Nehru woman being 
in it, I added that if she was not mentally conditioned, a mere 
MP's job could only result in frustration and disappointment. On 
the other hand, she had all the facilities and time in Raj Bhawan 
to write the memoirs she had been planning for a long time. She 
said she was fed up with being a Governor who was no more than 
an organ-grinder's monkey. So she plunged into politics again and 
got elected to Lok Sabha. I felt sorry for her. 

The years after Nehru's death had been not only an unrewarding 
but a tormenting period for Vijaya Lakshmi. She and Indira had 
never got on well in the past. When Indira became PM, things 
became worse for Vijaya Lakshmi. Indira foolishly took delight in 
being vindictive to her aunt. She was excluded even from official 
social functions. Word went round that contact with Vijaya 
Lakshmi was viewed with disfavour. Most people began to avoid 
her. When- things became intolerable, Vijaya Lakshmi resigned 
from the Lok Sabha, went away from Delhi and settled down in 
Dehra Dun. 

In the 1977 Lok Sabha elections Vijaya Lakshmi came out of 
her retirement like a wounded tigress and helped in flattening out 
her niece, j watched as the inexorable process of one of the 
greatest of basic human passions— revenge with a vengeance— un- 
folded itself. Vijaya Lakshmi would, of course, say that it was for 



142 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

the restoration of democracy, rule of law, and human values. That 
also is not incorrect. 

A couple of years ago Vijaya Lakshmi asked me, "Why did 
Bhai drop me completely during the last phase of his life?" I did 
not wish to answer that question at the time, and managed to 
change the subject. I have already given in this chapter part of the 
reason. The other part is that Nehru did not want to build up a 
rival to his daughter who was much younger. More about this in 
the chapter on Indira! 



27 Some Books 



S. Gopal's "Biography of Jawaharlal Nehru" (Vol. 1) 

This is a disappointing book for which the author was extravagantly 
paid and certain other facilities were provided by the Nehru 
Memorial Fund in addition to allowing him to keep the royalties. 
The book is as dry as midsummer hay. It reads like a thesis of 
a young student for his M. Litt in History. It will remain at best as 
a miniature filing cabinet. 

A concocted story in the book about what transpired at Krishna 
Menon's meeting with Molotov in 1946 should not be allowed to 
pass as history. Here is what Gopal has written: 

As a step in building up an independent foreign policy unaligned 
to any Power, Jawaharlal had preferred to develop informal 
contacts rather than utilise British diplomatic representation 
Acting as Jawaharlal's personal envoy, Krishna Menon met 
Molotov, conveyed the new Government's earnest desire for 
friendly relations with the Soviet Union and sought assistance in 
food-grains. He also, stepping beyond his brief, spoke to 
Molotov about the possibility of Soviet military experts visiting 
India. This upset not only the Foreign Office and the Indian 
External Affairs Department but also some of Jawaharlal's 
colleagues in the Congress; and Krishna Menon received the first 
of, over the years, very many mildly worded cautions from his 
chief: 

'I want to make it clear that I have complete faith in you and 
I am qmte sure that whatever step you will take will be taken 
after full consideration and with a view not to create any 
difficulties. So far as I am concerned, that is all right. But other 
people, who do not know you well, have also to be taken into 



™ Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

consideration and hence I have suggested to you that you might 
bear these people also in mind'. 

When Nehru appointed Krishna Menon as the personal represen- 
tative of the Vice-President of the interim government in September 
1946 to visit certain European capitals to pave the way for establish- 
ing diplomatic relations, Moscow was specifically excluded from 
his itinerary due to opposition from Gandhiji and Sardar Patel. 
Krishna Menon was upset at this exclusion. On his return from 
Western Europe Krishna Menon wrote a personal note in his own 
hand and gave it to me. In that he appealed to Nehru to send him 
to Moscow to do at least preliminary soundings for establishing 
trade relations. Nehru's letter to Krishna Menon dated 13 October 
1946, quoted above by Gopal, was in reply to that. 

Nehru wrote a letter to Molotov on 21 September 1946 and sent 
it directly to Moscow. In it he had enquired if the Soviet Union t 

could render some food assistance to India. As Soviet Foreign h 

Minister M. Molotov, happened to be in Paris for the Peace Con- 
ference, V. K. Krishna Menon, who was then in Europe, was asked 
to pay a personal visit to him to convey the request for food assis- 
tance as well as the greetings of the interim government. This was 
disclosed by Nehru in the Central Legislative Assembly. 

So the. British Foreign Office, which in this context is the British 
Intelligence, planted on S. Gopal an absurd story of what transpir- 
ed at the meeting between Molotov and Krishna Menon. GopaL's 
concern at the British Foreign Office and the Indian External Affairs 
Department getting upset is amusing. The Indian External Affairs 
Department at that time consisted of Weightman, Duke, Fry and the 
young H. Dayal whose qualification was that he knew nothing about 
foreign affairs. 

Whatever might have been Krishna Menon's faults, he was not * 

capable of any blatant violation of Nehru's directives, more especi- 
ally in the early stages. 

It was foolish to seek assistance in foodgrains from the Soviet 
Union as that country had no surplus food so soon after the war 
during which it had lost Ukraine and certain other fertile regions 
to the Germans, apart from the continued adverse effects of the 
scorched-earth policy during the war. It was one of Nehru's impul- 
sive moves. I was then not working in government as I had refused 
to join government for a whole year and preferred to assist Nehru 



Some Books 145 

at his residence. I have no recollection of India having received any 
foodgrain assistance from the Soviet Union in the early years of our 
independence. 

_ The facts about the spadework for establishing diplomatic rela- 
tions between India and the Soviet Union are as follows: 

In the autumn of 1946 Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was leading the 
Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. 
V.K. Krishna Menon was not a full delegate; he was an alternate 
delegate. K.P.S. Menon was the Secretary-General of the delega- 
tion as well as an alternate delegate. Nehru sent a telegram to the 
leader of the Indian delegation suggesting that Krishna Menon and 
K.P.S, Menon might proceed to Moscow after the General Assembly 
session and broach with the Soviet Government the question of 
establishing diplomatic relations. The matter was mentioned to a 
Soviet delegate by the Secretary-General of the Indian delegation 
to be conveyed to Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, who was 
leading the Soviet delegation. Thereupon, Molotov invited 
Mrs Pandit and the entire Indian delegation to a delightful luncheon 
at his house, with vodka and wine flowing freely. By the time lunch 
was over, diplomatic relations had been practically established 
between India and the Soviet Union. Molotov said that it was un- 
necessary for anyone to go to Moscow for this purpose, that he 
would communicate with his government, and that he felt certain 
that the Soviet Government would only welcome our move. 

It might be mentioned that during Nehru's lifetime Krishna 
Menon never visited the Soviet Union. I believe that it was in 1967 
or thereabouts, when he was no longer in government, that Krishna 
Menon first visited the Soviet Union. It was in connection with 
some meeting of the World Peace Cqtmcil. 

Gopal has, several times in his book, referred to Krishna 
Menon as an Anglophil. It seems to be a case of the pot calling the 
kettle black. 

Maulana Azad's "India Wins Freedom" 

This is a book dictated to Humayun Kabir by Maulana Abul Kalam 
Azad in the evenings when the latter used to be in an expansive 
mood. 

The Maulana has praised Nehru for dropping the case against 
the political officer in Malakand, North- West Frontier Province, 



146 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

This official acted in an unabashed manner as ,the virtual agent of 
the Muslim League by instigating tribesmen to stage demonstrations 
against Nehru during his visit to that area in the middle of October 
1946 and to fire at him and his party. Nehru and Khan Sahib were 
in the first car. I was following in the second car with a couple of 
senior police officers, Nehru's car was hit by a bullet. We all got 
down. A bullet whistled past me almost touching my nose. For the 
first time I felt content that I^3id not have a pronounced nose. 

On return to Delhi, Nehru took up the question on disciplinary 
action against the criminally erring official. Viceroy, Lord Wavell 
did everything to frustrate it. It dragged on and Nehru finally let it 
slide in disgust. He made no secret of his displeasure. The 
Maulana's conception of magnanimity to an official charged with 
criminal misconduct is absurd. ■ - 

Maulana Azad says that when the first dominion government was 
formed on 15 August 1947 Gandhiji had insisted that he should take 
up the Ministry of Education as it was of vital importance. This is 
totally incorrect. On Gandhiji's usual silence day on a Monday he 
wrote a personal letter to Nehru on the inside of a used envelope 
advising him not to make Maulana Azad the Education Minister as 
he was convinced that the Maulana would ruin education. Gandhiji 
added that the Maulana should be a Minister without Portfolio in 
the Cabinet and function as an elder statesman. Nehru could not 
comply with Gandhiji's wishes because the Maulana adopted the 
attitude "Education or nothing." 

Gandhiji's letter is in the archives I painstakingly built up from 
1946 onwards and left behind in the old Prime Minister's house, 
now called Teen Murti House. 

Incidentally, Gandhiji's choice for the Education Ministry was 
Zakir Husain. 

HlREN MUKERJEE'S "THE GENTLE COLOSSUS" 

Of all the books written about Nehru after his death, this little 
book has appealed to me the most. Of course, its size proclaims 
that it is not an exhaustive biography. And the author has no pre- 
tensions on that score. 



28 Maulana Abul Kalam Azad 



This handsome, impressive-looking Muslim divine, made more 
impressive by his neat moustache and well-trimmed goatee with tall 
fez cap, was an orator in chaste Urdu. During the rare occasions 
he spoke in parliament, there was a rush for seats. He was a divine- 
only in so far as his vast knowledge of Muslim religious lore and 
his internationally famous commentary on the Koran were 
concerned. For the. rest he was a man of the world who loved the 
good things of life. 

In 1945, soon after his release from prison, some puritanical 
people reported to Gandhiji that the Maulana was drinking 
regularly in jail. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur told me that at their first 
meeting after release from jail, Gandhiji had asked the Maulana 
whether he drank. The Maulana denied the reports. An element of 
doubt persisted in Gandhiji's mind. 

On 28 April 1946, while the Congress Working Committee was 
still engaged in examining the British Cabinet Mission's proposals, 
news reached Gandhiji that the Maulana, who was then Congress 
President, had written a letter to the Cabinet Mission without the 
knowledge of the Working Committee or himself. Humayun Kabir 
was the one who drafted the letter. The Maulana found similarity 
between his ideas of the solution of the communal problem and 
the ideas of the Cabinet Mission. The Maulana's solution was the 
maximum decentralization of power in the federal structure, with 
the provinces enjoying the largest measure of autonomy in all 
subjects, leaving the centre only with defence, foreign affairs, and 
communications. The Cabinet Mission found in the Maulana an 
ally in their difficult task. In the private letter to the Cabinet 
Mission, the Maulana had stated that there was no need for the 
Cabinet Mission to worry too much about Gandhiji or his 
misgivings about the Cabinet Mission's proposals. At the instance 



148 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

of Gandhiji, Sudhir Ghosh managed to get the letter as a 
temporary loan from the Cabinet Mission. As Gandhiji finished 
reading the letter and putting it aside on his small, low writing 
desk in front of him, the Maulana arrived for his previously 
arranged interview. Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, who was sitting behind 
a screen nearby, told me much later that she heard Gandhiji 
asking the Maulana a straight question whether he had written a 
letter to the Cabinet Mission about the negotiations in progress. 
The Maulana flatly denied having written any such letter. Gandhiji 
was stunned and deeply hurt at the Maulana's untruthfulness to 
him. 

Again, on 22 June 1946, it was known that the Maulana had 
written a private letter to Viceroy Lord Wavell assuring him that, 
as Congress President &gt; he would see to it that no Muslim name 
was included in the Congress list for the interim government, and 
if his own name was proposed, he would not agree to its inclusion. 
Again, the letter was drafted by Humayun Kabir. This upset not 
only Gandhiji but also Nehru and other members of the Working' 
Committee. Events overtook the Maulana and others -and Nehru 
replaced the Maulana as Congress President. Actually, Nehru 
included three Muslims in the interim government which took 
office on 2 September 1946. The Maulana then had no choice but 
to keep out. 

I have referred to the Maulana in several other chapters. The 
Maulana was a vindictive man. His fierce opposition to Krishna 
Menon stemmed from the fact that during his visit to London a code 
telegram sent to the High Commission for the Maulana by the PM 
was delivered to him only seven days after its arrival in London, 
Also, Krishna Menon generally neglected the Maulana. Krishna 
Menon ought to have known that the Maulana was vain and 
sensitive, and it would have done Menon no harm if he had 
arranged for the Maulana some "spiritual nourishment." 

When the Maulana visited Germany, he stayed at the embassy 
in Cologne as the guest of Ambassador A.C.N. Nambiar who, as a 
meticulous person and an excellent host, knew the Maulana's tastes 
and habits. He set up a small bar in the Maulana's room with 
plenty of whisky, brandy, Moselle white wine, Rhine red wine, and 
French vintage champagne. The Maulana specially liked champagne 
while abroad. Nambiar discovered that the Maulana was most happy 
to be left alone in his room surrounded by the bottles. NambiaF 



Montana Abul Kalam Azad 149 

had only one complaint. He had invited several important 
Germans, ministers and others, for a dinner in honour of the 
Maulana. Immediately after the dinner the Maulana sneaked out 
and remained in his room alone sipping champagne. The same 
thing happened later in London where the Maulana stayed at the 
High Commissioner's residence in the Millionaires' Lane as the 
guest of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, who gave a dinner in honour of 
tie Maulana, The guests included Sir Anthony Eden, Lord 
Mount batten and several other dignitaries. The moment dinner 
was over, the Maulana quietly disappeared without attracting any- 
one's notice. Soon, Eden and others asked where the Maulana 
was. Mrs Pandit had to resort to a diplomatic white lie to save face. 
The fact was that the Maulana was in his room sipping 
champagne. 

On return from the tour, the Maulana was all praise for 
Nambiar as our best Ambassador abroad. T. T. Krishnamachari, 
without imbibing champagne or any other fluid, said the same 
thing about Ambassador Nambiar after his visit to Germany. 
Seeing that Ambassador Nambiar had no wife, TTK told me that 
he would sanction a social secretary for him if the External Affairs 
Ministry would send him a note. This was done. 

In Delhi, the Maulana never attended a dinner party. He came 
to the PM's house only for lunches in honour of important foreign 
dignitaries. At Cabinet meetings, which were normally fixed for 
5 p.m. or soon after, the Maulana would get up at the stroke of 
six, regardless of the importance of the subject under discussion, 
and leave. Soon he would be before his whisky, soda and ice and 
a plate of samosas. Only a few persons were allowed to see him 
while he was drinking. They included Nehru, Aruna Asaf Ali, 
Humayun Kabir and a Private Secretary whom he personally 
liked. Nehru avoided seeing him in the evenings except when there 
was something urgent to discuss. 

One day the Maulana's favourite Private Secretary came to see 
me privately. He told me that he was worried about the Maulana 
because he was imbibing half a bottle of whisky every evening. 
Falls were not infrequent. In fact he had broken his back in a 
fall and had to wear a metal plate to support his back. Since 
then an able-bodied man was always available to support the 
Maulana whenever he got up during and after his drinks. The 
Private Secretary told me that the only person the Maulana would

listen to was the PM. He asked me, "Can't Panditji speak to the 
Maulana and ask him to limit his pegs?" I promised to convey his 
suggestion to the PM, When I spoke to Nehru, he simply smiled. 

As a departmental minister, the Maulana was a disaster, as 
Gandhiji had feared. He made no contribution to education. He 
left everything to the trio— Humayun Kabir, K.G. Saidayin and 
Ashfaque Hussain. 

It must be said to the credit of the Maulana that among collea- 
gues he was a rare one who was not afraid of Nehru. He spoke 
out his mind without fear or any inhibition. 

Around 1956, while the PM was in London, a telegram came 
from Cabinet Secretary Sukthankar saying that the Maulana was 
insisting on being officially referred to as Acting PM. He asked for 
instructions. Nehru replied that there was no such thing as Acting 
PM as long as he was alive; his absence from India made no 
difference; and that only the President can designate an Acting 
PM which can normally be if the PM is incapacitated. 

The Cabinet Secretary was asked to send a copy of the telegram 
to the Maulana. The next day the senior PTI representative in 
London came to se^ me and said that a comic situation had 
developed in India and the Maulana had arrogated to himself the 
title of Acting PM, and was going about with a motor-cycle in 
front and a security car behind, thereby making himself ridiculous. 
He added that the only thing the Maulana had not done was to 
move into the PM's house. I explained to him the correct position 
as contained in the PM's telegram to the Cabinet Secretary. The 
PTI representative beamed it to India as a statement from me. On 
seeing it, the Maulana became furious. He sent a strongly- worded 
telegram to the PM protesting against my "statement." The PM 
replied to him giving the circumstances in which I had to explain 
the position to the PTI representative who should not have used 
my name. The PM also added that I was not lacking in respect for 
the Maulana. When we arrived in Bombay from London, Morarji 
Desai was at the airport. He took me aside and complimented me 
for my "statement." 1 told him the Maulana was furious with me, 
to which he replied, "What does it matter to you?" 

The Maulana was not wholly free from communal ism as Rafi 
Ahmed Kidwai was. In the selection -of candidates for the 1952 
genera] elections, the Maulana would arrive with lots of slips 
containing Muslim names and passionately plead for them. U.S.

Malliah, who was co-General Secretary of the AICC with Lai 
Bahadur, got fed up with the Maulana. He played two tricks on 
the old man. When the Tamil Nadu list came up, Malliah had 
asked his friend Kamaraj to absent himself during the morning 
session. During that period Malliah criticized the Tamil Nadu list 
in so far as a particular constituency was concerned. Malliah 
suggested the name of a Muslim to replace the candidate suggested 
by the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee. The Maulana was very 
pleased and said, "Jtakho Bhai" (keep it brother). In the afternoon 
Kamaraj appeared on the scene and asked for reconsideration of 
the candidate for the particular constituency as the Muslim candi- 
date had died thirty years previously and that Malliah was not 
aware of the death of that prominent nationalist Muslim. Every- 
one laughed except Kamaraj and Malliah, and the Maulana 
looked foolish. 

Before the Kerala list came up, Malliah had a talk with the 
representatives of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee. In the 
predominantly Muslim areas of Moplahs in northern Kerala, 
where the Muslim League was sure to win, the KPCC had decided 
not to contest. At Malliah's request, they gave him a supple- 
mentary list of constituencies and names of Muslims who could be 
persuaded to file their nominations by giving them the deposit 
money. Malliah told them that the AICC would give the KPCC 
an additional grant to cover the deposit money. He told them that 
no money should be spent on campaigns in those constituencies. 
When the KPCC's original list came up for consideration, Malliah 
held forth and said that in a state where one-third of the popula- 
tion was Muslim, the KPCC list contained only three Muslims for 
the assembly elections. He said it was shocking and reeled out the 
names of constituencies and Muslim candidates who could be put 
up. The Maulana was very pleased and thereafter considered 
Malliah a truly noncommunal Congressman— which, of course,- he 
was. Eventually, all the Muslim candidates whom Malliah had 
added, lost their deposits— as Malliah knew in advance. 

The Maulana's greatest opponent in the Congress was 
Vallabhbhai Patel and his staunchest supporter was Nehru who had 
affection for him and showed him deference as an elder even when 
he disagreed with him. 

In the previous chapter I have referred to the Maulana's book 
India Wins Freedom. The Maulana, who had already lost his 



152 Reminiscences of the Nehru Age 

credibility, had dictated the book in the evenings to Humayun 
Kabir when he was inebriated. The unpublished portion of the 
book in the possession of the National Archives; when released to 
the public, should be treated with the caution and reserve it 
deserves.

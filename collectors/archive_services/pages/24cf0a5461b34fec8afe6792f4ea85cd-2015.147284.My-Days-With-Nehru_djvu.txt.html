Prologue 


This book is in fulfilment of my promise contained in the first. I con- 
tinue to be guided by the philosophy contained in the preface to my 
first book. No historic person has escaped the closest scrutiny of 
history. In an open society governed by elected representatives, people 
have the right to know all about those who govern them. Only the 
old people of both the sexes cling to the absurdity of making the 
senseless distinction between the public figure whom history may claim 
and the private person in whom history has no right. 

I wanted to include in the present book the chapter “SHE” which 
was withdrawn from the first. I was fully aware that the publication 
of the chapter would have exposed me to criticism from people with 
old-world ideas; but I was prepared to face it. However, it occurred 
to me that it would gravely embarrass the other person involved who 
is still alive; and I happen to know that the other person does not 
possess the “couldn’t-care-less” attitude which I have. 

“The Story of a Film” is a new chapter I wrote for the second book. 
It contains sensational stuff. The film covers the happening in the 
Dwaraka Suite of Rashtrapati Bhawan in the afternoon of a day in 
1966 and was taken by a senior member of the government’s Intelli- 
gence Service well-known to me (now retired). The person involved 
should thank the stars that the film, by a quifk of fate, fell into my 
safe hands. I am not including the chapter in this book for the 
reasons mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The publication of the 
chapter might also cause international repercussions harmful to the 
country now. 

The central figure, I mean the other person, in both the chapters 
is the same. 

Having made some allowance to hoary conventions, I would like to 
state that history shall not be denied for ever what is its due. I have 
made arrangements to have the contents of the two chapters made 
public after the life-time of the person involved. The only drawback 
is that the present generation is denied the opportunity to draw some 
lessons from the contents of the two chapters. That, however, cannot 
be helped. 



Prologue 


Reviews Reviewed 

Originally it was my intention to write and leave a record of my 
experiences to be published only after my lifetime. During the early 
part of the emergency I received authentic information that the 
numerous steel filing cabinets containing valuable archives I painstak- 
ingly built up from 1946 onwards at considerable personal expense and 
kept in the old Prime Minister’s House, now called Teen Murti House, 
were broken open under Indira’s personal instructions and made avail- 
able to an unauthorised person who was asked to destroy certain 
categories of documents and papers which were considered inconveni- 
ent. This inexcusable act, of vandalism had its impact on me. Then I 
had reliable information that my residence was going to be searched 
in order to take away such papers and documents as were still in my 
personal possession. This information was conveyed to me privately 
in good time by two officers of the government Intelligence Service 
who knew me personally. In fact they helped me to remove the 
documents, papers and other material to safety. Eventually it dawned 
on Indira that I was not the person to take this sort of thing lying 
down and that ultimately she would be the sufferer. So, in her own 
interest, she came to the conclusion that discretion was the better part 
of valour and called off her foolish venture. 

These two incidents made me change my mind. Thus I decided to 
accelerate my writing work and to publish the book as early as possi- 
ble. I finished the work at the end of September 1977. 

When I made my decision, I knew that I would be treading on the 
toes of many people; that my book would be sensational in parts and 
generally controversial; and that I woulii'be inviting hostile criticism 
from some newspaper reviewers. I decided to take the risk and face 
the consequences, instead of looking down on people from the safety 
of remote elysium. 

One criticism is that “the dead tell no tales; and there is plenty in 
the way of fulsome revelation about men and women who have no 
rebuttal.” This is a fallacious argument. The four greatest historic 
figures, on whom most books have been written, are the following, in 
the order mentioned: 

Jesus Christ, Napoleon Bonaparte, William Shakespeare, Oliver 
Cromwell. 

Most of the books, if not all, on these historic men were written 
after their death. Is it the argument that these books should not have 
been written because “the dead tell no tales and they have no rebut- 
tal?” How absurd! 



Prologue 


vii 


An interesting biography of Catherine the Great, written long years 
after her death, has revealed to the world that not a single child of 
hers was legitimate and that, after the age of 60, one of her earliest 
lovers, Prince Potemkin, selected a young boy of 20 to be her lover, 
and Catherine accepted him after mating him with one of her ladies- 
in -waiting to make sure that he was not suffering from any undesir- 
able disease. Where Catherine was concerned, “mother-hood was a 
certainty, but father-hood was an act of faith.” This remarkable 
woman, who ruled Russia for 34 years, had innumerable lovers; but 
she was never dominated by any one of them. It was she who 
governed Russia, not her favourites. Incidentally, all her lovers were 
Russians even though she was of German stock. 

A recent book on the Bonaparte family has stated “Eliza, the elder 
of the two sisters of Napoleon, sitting in Italy as the Queen of Naples, 
made a fortune by selling marble busts of Napoleon and finally she 
and her husband -Murat betrayed him. She went to the extent of sleep- 
ing with the Austrian Foreign Minister Prince Maternich in a desperWe 
attempt to safeguard her position after the fall of Napoleon. Jerome 
sold his 20-year-old daughter for several million Francs to a Russian 
sadist. The story of her nightly woes ultimately reached the Czar who 
intervened successfully to rescue her. Pauline, the nymphomaniac and 
the most likeable of the Bonaparte clan, changed lovers as often as 
she changed clothes. She always suffered from low blood circulation 
resulting in perpetual cold feet. In order to keep her toes warm she 
used to tuck them under the bare breasts of one of her boxum ladies- 
in-waiting. 

Can any reviewer say that the two books mentioned above should 
not have been written because the persons concerned “had no rebut- 
tal?” How ridiculous! I hope our Women politicians will not go on 
deputation to Prime Minister Morarji Desai “protesting against the 
desecration of illustrious women’s memory” and behave like a bunch 
of agitated crows. 

Voltaire has said “to the dead one owes nothing but the truth.” 
Indians, fortunately, have never been used to ancestor-w'orship. 

In all vital persons sex is a pronounced factor. This was true of 
Gandhi, Nehru, Julius Caesar, Cleopatra, Napoleon, Madame de 
Stael, Mozart, Beethovan, Chopin, Lizst, Catherine the Great, Stalin, 
Hitler, Ramsay Macdonald, Lloyd George — to name a few. The only 
significant exception I can think of was Winston Churchill. I knew 
two persons who were born eunuchs, two who were man-made 
eunuchs, and one a self-made eunuch. They were the most disgusting 
“men” I had the misfortune to come across. To women they were

Prologue 


abominable. Women’s attitude to them was one of extreme contempt 
—the same as that of a mare towards a gelding. But one should not 
Ignore the fact that it was the obscure Chinese eunuch Tsai Lun, who 
invented paper about the turn of the first century ad. 

The great historian Lord Acton’s maxim “what is concealed is not 
worth preserving” has great relevance. Any attempt at artificial 
investing of irrelevant “virtues” in a person and trying to perpetuate 
it by subtle propaganda is a fraud on history and will not stand the 
test of time. 

One scribe has used the expression “being untrue to one’s salt” 
(namak haram) about me. If the truth were to be told, I was as much 
indebted to Nehru as he was to me. I didn’t want a government job 
from him at any time. In fact I refused one for a whole year in 1946 
and stayed out of government. 

The justification for certain disclosures in my book is contained in 
the Preface. Nehru never came down in my estimation even by a 
millimetre because of his fondness for women. It would have been 
unnatural if it were otherwise. Nehru did not belong to a religious 
order which imposed celibacy. And I was never a mid-Victorian 
prude. 

A journalist-reviewer in the Times of India has asked a relevant 
question as to how Nehru managed after I left government in 1959. 
All except him know that it was not much of a management. It was 
a sorry spectacle of slow but steady deterioration, both mental and 
physical, and final collapse of the man I knew. I would like the 
reviewer to find out how many public statements of Nehru during this 
period had to be “clarified” by the officials of the External Affairs 
Ministry. 

Arthur M. Schlessinger Jr, Special Assistant to President Kennedy, 
and a distinguished historian, has referred to Nehru and his visit to 
the United States in November 1961 in his book A Thousand Days, 
Here are some extracts: 

Nehru’s strength was failing, and he retained control more by 
momentum of the past than by mastery of the present ... He was 
briefly gay with Mrs Kennedy. But when the talk turned to Vietnam 
during the luncheon, he fell into remote silence. It was heavy 
going, then and later . . . The private meetings between the Presi- 
dent and the Prime Minister were no better. Nehru was terribly 
passive, and at limes Kennedy was hard put to keep the conver- 
sation going ... It was, the President said later, like trying to grab 
something in your hand, only to have it turn out to be just fog. It

was all sad; this man had done so much for Indian independence; 
but he had stayed around too long, and now it is all going bit by 
bit. To Galbraith he once remarked that Lincoln was fortunate; 
ISlehru, by contrast, much less so . . . The following spring, reminis- 
cing about the meeting, Kennedy described it to me as ‘a disaster; 
the worst Head of State visit I have had’. It was certainly a disap- 
pointment, and Kennedy’s vision of India had been much larger 
before the visit than it would ever be again. Nehru was obviously 
on the decline; his country, the President now decided, would be 
increasingly preoccupied with its own problems and turn more and 
more into itself. Though Kennedy retained his belief in the neces- 
sity of helping India achieve its economic goals, he rather gave up 
hope, after seeing Nehru, that India would be in the next years a 
great affirmative force in the world or even in South Asia. 

Ambassador Galbraith has described Nehru’s speech at the UN 
General Assembly in New York on 10 November 1961, as a 
“performance that was far from distinguished.” And Galbraith was 
an admirer of Nehru. 

When the India-China border situation was in an uneasy state in - 
1962, Nehru said something at the airport in Delhi oh the eve of his 
departure for Ceylon, which surprised me beyond measure. Many did 
not like Nehru leaving the capital at that juncture. In reply to a 
correspondent’s question about the Chinese menace, Nehru said “I 
have ordered the army to throw them out.” It was obvious that this 
was the language of a man speaking from a position of weakness. I 
have information to indicate that this provocative statement of Nehru 
was the immediate reason for the Chinese crossing the Himalayas into 
the plains of Assam. The Chinese obviously had no purpose except to 
gain a psychological advantage. It was also the same statement of 
Nehru which provoked Chou En lai to say later that Nehru was the 
most arrogant man he had met. 

I have never suffered from over-humility; and I am vain enough to 
assert that if I were with Nehru officially, the deal with the United 
States about the installation and partial use of a high-power radio 
transmitter in eastern India by the Voice of America, would have been 
nipped in the bud at the initial proposal stage. It was a bewildered 
man, ill-advised by incompetent and unimaginative officials, who 
allowed this deal, which would have compromised our sovereignty, to 
be entertained and almost finalized. If I were with Nehru, Kamaraj 
Plan would have been limited to Kamaraj and not allowed to assume 
diabolic significance. If I were with Nehru, no permission would have 



^ ' Prologue 

been given to place a nuclear power-pack of Nanda Devi as I would 
have considered the venture an exercise in futility insofar as India 
was concerned. There is no need to dwell any more on this subject. 

A lawyer-journalist reviewer, who writes as if, by some divine dis- 
pensation, he is the custodian of the morals of mankind, has given 
an excerpt from Nehru’s press conference of 7 Febru’afy 1959: 
“Question; The editor of a Bombay weekly has wid that India got the 
entire Bhilai steel plant because of a private conversation between 
Mr Mathai and Mr Menshikov. Mr Nehru: I do hot know. I have not 
heard of it.” What Nehru said is true; he was only expressing his 
ignorance. I would suggest that the reviewer might find out from 
Menshikov who is still alive. The Bombay Weekly eAiiov'K.Yi. Karanjia 
continues to be a much better informed person than this reviewer on 
many matters. 

The lawyer-journalist reviewer has questioned my statement that 
Nehru kept my letter of resignation pending for six days. If he had 
the patience, the reviewer could have found out from Appendix III 
in my book that my letter was dated 12 January 1959, and was 
published on 17 January 1959. During this intervening period the 
letter in original was with Nehru. During the period 12 January 1959, 
to the date of the acceptance of the resignation Nehru had told 
Morarji Desai that he was not going to accept the resignation. The 
reviewer can check up with Morarji Desai if he likes. My resignation 
was accepted after the publication of my letter and that too after I 
insisted on being set free. If the reviewer had consulted any news- 
paper, he could have easily verified the correctness of my statement 
and avoided the most irresponsible and astounding assertion that rhy 
resignation was submitted in a huff and instantly accepted! On 18 
January 1959, I sent to Nehru a personal letter informing him that 
under no circumstances was I prepared to continue. 1 gave him free- 
dom to make public my refusal to continue if he was keen to avoid 
the impression that he had accepted my resignation because of 
extraneous pressure. Before midnight he replied:

The acceptance of my resignation was announced in the morning 
papers of 19 January 1959. 

The lawyer-journalist reviewer has classified me as anti-Russian and 
pro-lsraeli. Obviously the man has bats in his belfry^ just as Aruna 
Asaf AH had in 1947 when she called Nehru the Kerensky of India 
and made the most profound prediction that he would not last long. 
That was when the woman was having a brief honeymoon with the 
Communist Party of India. The rulers of Russia under the Stalinist 
regime also had bats in their belfry when they called Nehru the run- 
ning dog of imperialism. John Foster Dulles suffered from the same 
malady when he violently criticized Nehru and described non-align- 
ment as immoral. Bhupesh Gupta suffers from the same disease when 
he calls everyone except himself a foreign agent. Recently I met a 
prominent member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) who 
also had nothing but bats in his belfry. He went into a vituperative 
harangue against Nikita Khrushchev, for whom I always had a soft 
corner. He blurted out all the abusive epithets in the CPM jargon. 
When he had let off enough steam, I asked him to cool down and tell 
me in one brief sentence why he hated Khrushchev so much. He 
replied “Khrushchev was pro-Russian.” But in this galaxy of infan-

tile minds, I have no hesitation in according the pride of place to the 
lawyer-journalist reviewer.

In the mean time I shall give some home-work to the lawyer- 
journalist reviewer. Apart from Soviet Ambassador Menshikov, 
1 personally liked Malcolm Macdonald, the British High Commis- 
sioner, and Ellsworth Bunker, the American Ambassador. I consi- 
dered both of them as imaginative persons endowed with vision and 
sincerity and were devoid of pomposity. Both were non-career diplo- 
mats. These two sent a private message to me through Secretary-General 
N.R. Pillai suggesting an informal meeting. They had indicated that the 



Prologue 


xiii 

subject to be discussed was Kashmir. The meeting of the four took 
place in Malcolm Macdonald’s house. Detailed maps of India and 
Pakistan showing the State of Jammu and Kashmir were at hand. The 
two diplomats had several talks earlier on the subject. At the outset 
N.R. Pillai told them that he was not representing the government and 
that he would only be a silent observer. 1 said “you all know that I re- 
present nothing and nobody and so I shall speak without inhibition.” 

The diplomats said that the Kashmir question was a difficult one 
made more difficult by the cold war atmosphere at the UN. They 
were of the view that the UN would never be able to solve the 
Kashmir problem. They said that insofar as India was concerned, 
wisdom lay in forgetting, for the present, the political aspect of the 
Kashmir question by concentrating on removing from the minds of 
the Pakistanis their apprehensions about uninterrupted supply of 
water from the rivers flowing from Jammu and Kashmir. They advo- 
cated an agreement on this and registering it with the UN. I said that 
the most appropriate thing would be to take up all the rivers of the 
“Land of the Five Rivers” and hammer out a comprehensive treaty 
under international auspices; and added that the prospe^ of achiev- 
ing this would be brighter in Nehru’s life-time. Both the diplomats 
welcomed the idea; and Ellsworth Bunker said that it was possible to 
bring the World Bank into the picture. This was the beginning of the 
Indus Water Treaty. Both the diplomats worked hard on their 
governments like a pair of beavers until the project took shape. 

The two diplomats made a prediction: “If you are patient and 
leave the Kashmir question alone, within 50 years the atmosphere in 
India and Pakistan will change and both countries will reconcile 
themselves to drawing up a permanent international boundary along 
the line of actual control with adjustments dictated by facts of 
geography.” I said “I doubt if India will agree to give up the sparsely 
populated Gilgit'area which is of strategic importance to a large 
country.” 

Ellsworth Bunker, Malcolm Macdonald, and N.R. Pillai are still 
alive and it is open to the lawyer-journalist reviewer to verify from 
them. 

A young journalist published a review of my book in the magazine 
Femina dated December 30, 1977 — January 22, 1978. In the midst 
of numerous factual errors and some rather foolish statements, he 
correctly assessed something in me — male chauvinism. Yes, I share the 
view of John Keats “the opinion I have of the generality of women— 
who appear to me as children to whom I would rather give a sugar 
plum than my time — forms a barrier against matrimony which I re- 



Prologue 

joice in.” One of the things I bate most is to go shopping with a 
woman. I do not think I can ever sleep in a room at night if there is 
a woman in it. I cannot bear the thought of sharing a bathroom with 
a woman. I also share the view of a wisecrack who said about 
women “You cannot live with them, and you cannot live without 
thenn” When Madame de Stael once asked Napoleon “What is the 
most desirable quality you expect in a woman?,” he replied “capacity 
to produce a number of children.” Madame de Stael, who started 
with having a crush on Napoleon, promptly reported to Josephine, 
Napoleon’s statement, in an attempt to create trouble between the two. 
When a similar question was put to Kemal Ataturk, while he was in high 
spirits after “imbibing,” by one of his cronies, the old soldier replied 
in one word “availability.” I share Napoleon’s opinion, as expressed 
to Marie Walewaska, “I was a fool to. expect understanding from a 
woman.” However, I realise that without women the world will come 
to an end. 

To receive innumerable letters from a variety of people, who have 
actually read my book, was a refreshing experience for me. Only 
three of them were critical. Those who expressed themselves appro- 
vingly include several educationists, historians, retired judges, and a 
host of others including prominent journalists, lawyers and some MPs 
and other legislators who are not obscurantists. Practically all of them 
deprecated the practice of investing politicians with divinity. One 
wrote that it is absurd to accuse politicians of being the repository of 
all virtues,, personal or political. He added that politicians should be 
treated as ordinary mortals; and that if any politician has to be 
elevated as a rishi, let him not be put on a pedestal higher than 
Vishwamitra. 

I totally reject the.pontifications of ignorant politicians, some hot 
very profound journalists and other hysterical women; and stand 
resolutely by what is contained in the preface to my first book and in 
this prologue. 

In spite of the ignorant, prejudiced, and unenlightened critics, a 
well-known non-official organization has included my book in the 
“suggested readings, on India, for compulsories and Viva Voce" for 
young people who appear for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), 
the Indian Foreign Service (IFS), and other Central Services exami- 
nation. Over 30,000 candidates sit for the initial written examination 
annually. Other authors in the list include Dr S. Radhakrishnan, 
K.M. Panikkar, E.M. Forster, Aldous Huxley, V.S. Naipaul, and 
Arthur Koestler.

1 Shradha Mata 


In my book, Reminiscences of the Nehru Age, I had mentioned 
“Shradha Mata” was an assumed name. I was under the impression 
that she was living in Jaipur as a normal person under a normal name. 
If I had known the correct position, I would have disguised her and 
saved her from personal embarrassment. I am sorry about having put 
her in a position where she has to resort to the inalienable right to 
denials and concoctions. 

The editor of the fortnightly magazine India Today took the trouble 
of sending a team of his editorial staff to Jaipur to investigate and in- 
terview the woman in the suffron robe and burdened with a rudraksha 
mala of two strings of oversized beads. Incidentally I must confess 
that experience has led me to view all rudraksha malas with extreme 
suspicion. The results of their investigations and an interview with her 
were published in its issue dated 16-28 February 1978. After reading 
what appeared in India Today, I was much impressed by Shradha 
Mata’s consummate skill in taking the editor and the two members 
of his investigating staff for a ride. 

The Deccan Herald, a daily newspaper of Bangalore in its issue, 
dated 15 February 1978, published a lengthy report by its corres- 
pondent P. Frederick Ignatius. Since it has considerable relevance, 1 
am quoting it below in full by courtsey of Deccan Herald: 

BANGALORE, Feb. 14— 

Deccan Herald is in a position to contradict some of Mr. M. O. 
Mathai’s assertions regarding Jawaharlal Nehru and Shraddha Matha 
in respect of her sojourn in Bangalore. 

In the chapter on “Nehru and his Women” in his book Remini- 
scences of the Nehru Era, Mr. Mathai claims that a young woman 
from the North came to a convent in the city, gave birth to a boy and 
left the child behind. Mr. Mathai also says, “I made discreet enqui- 
ries repeatedly about the boy, but failed to get a clue about his where- 
abouts. Convent s^'in such matters are extremely tight-lipped and 
secretive. Had I succeeded in locating the boy, I would have adopted 
him. He must have grown up as a Catholic Christian blissfully igno- 
rant of who his father was.” 



2 


My Days with Nehru 

The facts are that a woman calling herself Shraddha Matha did 
-come to Bangalore in mid-May 1949 and did give birth to a child in a 
IRoman Catholic hospital a fortnight later. But the child was still-born. 

Shraddha Matha did not stay in a convent either. She stayed in a 
Ihouse in Benson Town. She left behind affectionate tetters from 
Jawaharlal Nehru addressed to “Shraddha Matha ” 

These letters reached Mr. Nehru, not through a convent, but 
'throngh a noted Hindi scholar and Professor of English, Dr. Karam- 
chand Wade of Cox Town. He got possession of the letters in a 
curious way which will be described later. Mr. Mathai writes in his 
book; “In November 1949aconventin Bangalore sent a decent looking 
person to Delhi with a bundle of letters. He (the bearer of the letters) 
said that a young woman from northern India had arrived at the con- 
vent a few months ago and had given birth to a baby boy. She refused 
to divulge any particulars about herself. She left the convent as soon 
as she was well enough to move out but left the child behind.” 

The facts are that the young woman was looked after by Dr. (Mrs) 
Ezekiel and her husband and was taken to a hospital on May 30, 
•where she was delivered of a still-born baby, the same night. She was 
taken home to her place in Benson Town on June 9 and left the City 
for Delhi on June 19. 

“She however forgot to take with her a small bundle in which 
among other things letters in Hindi were found,” says Mr. Mathai and 
continues, “The Mother Superior, who was a foreigner, had the letters 
examined and was told that they were from the Prime Minister. The 
person who brought the letters surrendered them. But declined to give 
his name or the name of the convent or the name of the Mother Supe- 
rior. Nehru was told of the facts. He tore off the letters without any 
emotion reflected in his face. He showed no interest in the child then 
or latter.” 

That is not the way Dr. Karamchand Wade, who is now 85, recalls 
what happened. According to him Mr. Nehru was all candour and 
graciousness, took the letters and gave Dr. Karamchand a photostat 
copy of one of the letters as a keepsake and autographed a copy of his 
Discovery of India and presented to Dr. Karamchand. 

Dr. Karamchand asserts categorically that Mr. Mathai was not 
•present anywhere o^n the scene when he handed over the letters. He 
!also says that Nelnu asked him in future to write to him care of 
.Mr. Upadhya, one of his Secretaries. 

How did Dr. Karamchand get hold of the letters? He practically 
thought them from a man who appeared dramatically at his house in 
unid- August 1949. 



■Shradha Mata

The man introduced himself as Mr. Ezekiel, a partner in a firm of 
timber merchants doing business on Wheeler Road in Cox Town a 
short distance away from Dr. Karamchand’s house. 

Mr. Ezekiel said that he had come to .know that Dr. Karamchand 
Wade was a noted Hindi scholar. He said he wanted Dr. Wade's 
in help deciphering some letters written in a north Indian language 
•and handed over a bundle of letters. 

Dr. Karamchand took one look at the first letter, sent from the 
Oovernment House, Lucknow, on 2 March 1948, and was convinced 
that it was from Jawaharlal Nehru. 

Pleading that his wife was more proficient in Hindi than himself 
Dr. Karamchand took the letters inside his house and had consulta- 
tions with his wife. Both of them agreed that they must somehow keep 
the letters and send them on to Pandit Nehru. 

Returning to Mr. Ezekiel, Dr. Karamchand asked him as to how he 
had got hold of the letters. Mr. Ezekiel then produced a letter (now in 
Dr. Karamchand’s possession) which had been addressed to “Shrad- 
■dha Mathajee, C/o, Mr. Asutosh Lahiri, G.S.H.M.S., New Delhi.” The 
letter had been returned by the post office to the sender, Dr. (Mrs.) 
Ezekiel. 

' According to Mr. Ezekiel, the woman to whom the letter has been 
addressed had come to a hospital near the cantonment Railway 
Station on 15 May 1949. She was pregnant. But as she persistently 
refused to divulge her name or any particulars about herself for the 
Hospital Register, she was discharged three days later. 

Dr. (Mrs.) Ezekiel, who was working in the hospital, took pity on 
her and took her first to her own house and later set her up in a rented 
house in Benson Town. She later took her to a Roman Catholic Hos- 
pital in the Civil Station for examination on the day she was dischar- 
ged from.Dr. Ezekiel’s hospital. She also took the young woman to 
the hospital again a week later, but the pains proved false. She was 
taken to the hospital for antenatal examination on May 24. 

On May 30, Dr. Ezekiel examined the young woman and rushed her 
to hospital in a taxi (the number of which w'as taken by the Ezekiels 
for accounting purposes as they kept custody of the young w'omen’s 
money). .A still-born baby was born the same night. She was taken 
home from the hospital on June 9 and she flew to Delhi on June 19, 
after borrowing her air fare from the Ezekiels. She had left a bundle 
of letters behind. 

Before she left, the young woman had promised to send Rs. 600 to 
Dr. Ezekiel who had mortgaged her jewels to raise the money for air 
fare and for ther expenses incurred on her account.

My Days with Nehru 

In her letter to “Shraddha Mathajee.” Dr. Ezekiel says I haven’t 
paid Mrs. Hall yet “you have to pay Rs. 10 for rations, Rs. 1-8-0 for 
the dhobi and Rs. 50 for house rent” and “I am a poor soul with three 
children, from where will I get the money to redeem all my gold things 
which I had mortgaged for the amount to pay for your return back.” 

After going on for two pages and assuring -'‘Mathajee” that the 
money that had been given to the Ezekiels would be accounted for till 
“the last half anna” the letter ends with, “Don’t be afraid. I’ll never 
let out your secrets even if my wife is threatened. I’m very much wor- 
ried about your silence. After you left, many letters, came addressed to 
you. I got them all with me.” 

When this letter had been returned to Dr. Ezekiel by the Post Office, 
Mr. Ezekiel sought out Dr. Karamchand to find out whether there 
was a clue to the identity and address of the woman who called her- 
self, Shraddha Matha, especially as Dr. Ezekiel had found her repea- 
tedly reading one or other letter from the bundle of letters. 

Realising the importance of the letters. Dr. Karamchand gave Mr, 
Ezekiel Rs. 600 saying that he did not want the Ezekiels to have a poor 
opinion of his compatriot from the North, or to be out of pocket on 
her account after doing a charitable deed. 

Dr. Karamchand then wrote to Mr. A. Vithal Pai, principal Private 
Secretary to the Prime Minister, whom he had known while serving 
the Government College at Kumbakonam while Mr. Pai had been a 
Sub-Collector, regarding the letters in his possession. 

Mr. A.V. Pai wrote back to “Dear Karamchand,” saying other 
things: “It is of course possible that misleading and plausible interpre- 
tations might be put on one or two chits that you may have seen , . . 
but the Prime Minister himself is not worried about improper or mali- 
cious use being made of them. I shall however wait to see the letters 
when you send them to me.” 

Mr. Pai also said in his letter that neither he nor the Prime Minis- 
ter thoughtthat Dr. Karamchand should put himself to the trouble and 
expense of going over to Delhi for handing the letters over. He sugges- 
ted that the letters be sent by registered insured cover to his residen- 
tial address. 

Dr. Karamchand wrote again expressing apprehension about the 
letters and the personal damage they might possibly cause to the Prime 
Minister if they fell into wrong hands. He quoted one of the letters 
verbatim (Hindi into Romanised script) in which Pandit Nehru had 
stated that he might be able to sec Shraddha Matha after 10 p.m. 

Mr. Pai in reply said among other things: “It may well be that the 
letter quoted , . . was written by the Prime Minister; but no one need 



Shradha Mata

put any malicious interpretation on it. Evidently you arc not aware of 
the tempo at which the Prime Minister works. He works till 1.30 a.m. 
or 2 in the morning every night and it is not unusual for him to grant 
interviews to people after 10 p.m. You will notice that the letter you 
quote was written from the Lucknow Government House on the date 
of the death of Srimathi Sarojini Naidu. 

“Upadhyaji, who is mentioned in the letter, is one of the Secretaries 
and so far as I can make out it is possible that the Prime Minister did 
see her for a few minutes late that evening. The importance we attach 
to your letter is not because of any interpretation that can be placed in 
the message that you quote, but on the fact what you say shows up the 
woman in a very bad light.” 

Dr. Karamchand then resolved that it was his duty to lake letters 
himself to Delhi and hand them over to Jav/aharlal Nehru in person. 
He flew to Delhi on September 14 and handed the letters over the 
next day. 

According to Dr. Karamchand, Mr. Nehru didn’t say a word about 
the letters; “He just smiled aiid thanked me and gave a photostat copy 
of one of them for a keep-sake. Then he got up, picked a copy of Dis- 
covery of India and inscribed it for me.” 

The book and the photostat copy of the letters are Dr. Karamchand’s 
most valued possessions. He has kept the entire correspondence rela- 
ting to his brush with history. 

Shradha Mata has lost all credibility when she made the absurd 
and astounding assertion, “Nehru asked me many times to be Vice- 
President, but 1 always refused. I was not going to sit in Parliament.” 
I do not think that Nehru suffered from temporary insanity at any 
time to implore a young female like Shradha Mata repeatedly to be 
gracious enough to become Vice-President. Any further attempt on my 
part at contradicting her is redundant. Nevertheless, 1 shall make some 
observations to set the record straight. 

I notice that Shradha Mata often refers to herself in the third per- 
son especially when referring to Nehru and herself. The only other 
persons of comparable importance in history who resorted to this prac- 
tice are Charles de Gaulle and Kautilya! 

She says that Nehru had seen her pictures and had questioned 
Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee, who became her disciple, why thousands 
of people were running to have a glimpse of her; and that Nehru 
influenced Mookerjee to bring her to Delhi; and so she came, says 
she. This is pure concoction. Nehru and Mookerjee were unfriendly to 



6 


My Days with Nehru- 

each other throughout and it is unthinkable that Nehru would enlist 
his assistance in a matter like this. 

Other concoctions are that she was fasting unto death on the 
question of the name of India being changed to Bharat and that 
Nehru went to her residence to persuade her to break the fast. Thera 
was no need for anyone to fast on this non-issue. The matter was- 
vaguely raised in an informal manner by Rajendra Prasad and some 
others and was disposed off quietly. Nehru never visited her at her 
residence or in a park at any time either for hours at a time, as she 
has claimed, or even for minutes. She has never talked to Nehru on 
the telephone. Yet another concoction is her claim that her connection 
with Nehru lasted till 1958. It was only for a pitifully short period — 
from some time in 1948 to the spring of 1949. After that Nehru never 
met her; neither did he have any correspondence with her. The few 
brief letters (in Hindi) Nehru wrote to her were in reply to hers and 
were never sent by post — always by messenger. 

It' is pretty obvious that Shradha Mata suffers from hallucinations. 

A sentence in the report of /ut//a Today, “but the most important 
in the list of her admirers and chelas was the then Prime Minister 
of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru” only evoked a derisive smile 
in me. And, the editorial comment, “one resurrected legend from the 
past was that of a mysterious tantric spiritual, Shradha Mata, who 
had once held an inexplicable sway over the late Prime Minister of 
India” can only emenate from a person of unmitigated ignorance. 
Nehru never chased women; it was always w'omen who chased him. 

I repeat what I wrote in my previous book that no woman ever 
influenced Nehru in matters of state or, for that matter, in any impor- 
tant matter. 

Some time after Dr. S. Radhakrishnan became Vice-President, 
Shradha Mata met him and made a request that she be given some 
facilities to go abroad to spread “Indian Culture.” In all innocence 
Radhakrishnan mentioned the matter to Nehru in a casual way. I hap- 
pened to be present in Nehru’s study in the Prime Minister’s House at 
that time. Nehru sternly discouraged him. That was the end of Radha- 
krishnan being in her formidable list of “chelas” headed by Mahatma 
Gandhi! 

Now to the report in the Deccan Herald. Dr. Karamchand Wade 
has been described as a noted Hindi scholar. Why such a scholar 
should seek his wife’s assistance to read the simple brief Hindi letters is 
beyond my comprehension. 

It was from the article in the Deccan Herald dated 15 February 
1978, that I first heard of the name “Dr Karamchand Wade.” At no- 



Shradha Mata 


T 


time did the Prime Minister mention the name to me. He had no for- 
mal appointment with the Prime Minister; Vithal Pai just took him in. 
I have written in my first book that the person who came to Delhi with 
a bundle of letters declined to give me his name or that of the Convent 
or that of the Mother Superior. It was without the knowledge of Vithal 
Pai that the nameless person met me twice during the two days after 
he met Nehru. At the first meeting he raised the question, in a round 
about way, of the possibility of his receiving a suitable diplomatic 
assignment. He was well educated and looked a very presentable per- 
son. I thought normally he could be as good an ambassador as many 
of our then-existing ones; but the circumstances were singularly un- 
propitious. I neither encouraged him nor discouraged him. In the cour- 
se of the conversation, which was probing in so far as I was concerned, 
the nameless person admitted that he had not delivered to Nehru all 
the letters. On a somewhat stern demand from me, he placed on my 
table the remaining letters and solemnly assured me that none other 
existed. 

The nameless person had told me that Shradha Mata was in a Ro- 
man Catholic Convent and not in a Roman Catholic Hospital as he 
later conveyed to th'3 correspondent of the Deccan Herald. He also told 
me that she gave birth to a healthy baby-boy, and not a still-born child 
as he later conveyed to the correspondent of the Deccan Herald. 

Before the nameless person left my office, we had arranged for an- 
other meeting the next day. In the meantime I appraised Nehru of 
what happened at the nameless person’s meeting with me and gave him 
the rest of the Hindi letters. Nehru agreed with me that he should be 
adequately compensated for his travelling and all other incidental ex- 
penses. This was done at my second meeting with him the next day. 

I cannot understand how Nehru could possibly have given Dr 
Karamchand Wade at their only meeting a photostat copy of one of 
his letters to Shradha Mata. Did Nehru have the lime to go to a photo- 
graphic establishment to have the letter photostated? Or, had Dr. Wade 
done the mischief in Bangalore before coming to Delhi? Or, is Dr 
Wade’s memory failing him at the age of 85? 

Since Dr Karamchand has spoken to the press, I have no option 
but to make every thing public. I am sorry if I am embarrassing him. 

The discovery of the editorial staff of India Today that as early as 
1932 (when Shradha Mata was only 19) Nehru’s photograph was’in 
ihe. pooja room of this devotee of Shakti, and perhaps she was wor- 
shipping Nehru as a Devta; and Dr (Mrs) Ezakiel’s discovery that 
Shradha Mata was repeatedly reading one or the other letter “from 



o My Days with Nehru 

the bundle” at Bangalore are not irrelevcnt in assessing her emotional 
feelings towards Nehru. 

I neither worship living Devtas nor Devis. The only person in his- 
tory who worshipped a living Devi was Marshall Louis Alexandre 
Berthier, the famous Chief of Staff of Napoleon. The Devi was the 
beautiful Madame de Visconti, his Italian mistress. To compensate for 
her physical absence, Berthier erected an alter to her in his tent in the 
desert sands of Egypt. Every morning and evening Berthier knelt in 
front of Madame de Viscounti’s portrait at the altar. I am practical 
enough to observe that it is not seldom that, like the cassock, the suf- 
fron robe covers a multitude of sins. 

Shradha Mata of her younger days reminds me of some lines in 
Hilaire Belloc’s On Lady Poltagrue, a Public Peril: 

The Devil, having nothing else to do, 

Went off to tempt my Lady Poltagrue. 

My Lady, tempted by a private whim. 

To his extreme annoyance, tempted him. 

I see no reason to amend anything I have written in my previous 
book about this so-called tantric spiritual. “What is written has been 
written.” 



2 Of Animals and Children, Flowers and Plants 


Apart from his attraction for mountains, love of animals and children 
as well as flowers, plants and trees was one of Nehru’s pronounced 
qualities. His love of children was totally different from that of pro- 
fessional politicians of the West for whom patting and kissing 
children in public is a vote-catching gimmick. To all normal people 
children are a joy to watch and to play with. Nehru saw in their 
innocent faces and sparkling eyes the future of India. He was con- 
vinced that no amount of money spent on children and their mothers 
was too much, and that it was a sound investment for the future. He 
was deeply interested in any scheme designed to benefit children and 
women, more especially the provision of mid-day meal for the under- 
previleged school children. 

Nehru was responsible for Indian schools introducing knapsack 
which would hang on the backs of children instead of the front or the 
sides. He wanted children not to be stooping but to be erect while 
walking with a load of books on their backs. Nehru was interested in 
almost everything. He retained the curiosity of a child throughout 
his life. When he heard that the extraordinarily good and motherly 
American woman, who was the wife of the American Ambassador 
Ellsworth Bunker, had devised some simple contraption, which would 
be of help to sweepers, he promptly invited her to tea on a Sunday 
afternoon at the Prime Minister’s House. The elderly woman came 
in style in a huge Cadillac with a long-handled broom. She held the 
theory that the backs of sweepers in Delhi, particularly women, were 
bent because they had been using short brooms all their lives. Nehru 
tried the broom outside the Prime Minister’s House. He later asked 
the Delhi Municipal Corporation and the New Delhi . Municipal 
Committee to introduce the long-handled broom and supply them 
to aU the sweepers. The Ambassador’s wife said she felt amply rewar- 
ded and made the comment “nothing moves in Delhi unless the 
Prime Minister takes interest.” The book Ugly American, which 
created a sensation in the United States and elsewhere, makes a refe- 
rence to this without mentioning names of individuals or the country. 

Nehru was somewhat rough with children, of course, in a playful 
mood. He believed in the toughening process for children and young

My Days with Nehn.\ 

people. He disapproved of Indira’s scheme of herding little school 
children to shout “Chacha Nehru” on his birthdays. Indira was. 
responsible for declaring 14 November (Nehru’s birthday) as Child- 
rens Day in India. That is one of the good -and appropriate things- 
she has done. 

While Rajiv and Sanjay were little children, Indira acquired a 
sheep dog from Kashmir and named him “Sona.” He was no good 
for the children as he spent all his time wandering as a hefty stray 
dog looking for fights. He, however, never failed to come to the 
house exactly on time for his daily meal. He committed the mistake 
of his life by biting the hand of Lady Mountbatlen as she tried to' 
fondle him. That was the end of Sona. At Nehru’s instance, Indira 
sent Sona to the vet, without the knowledge of the children, to be put 
out. 

Then Indira’s aunt Krishna Hutheesing, sent a golden retriever 
puppy (female) for the children from the litter of her favourite dog. 
The little puppy was named Lassie. She grew up as a lanky and 
extremely intelligent dog. She had the peculiar capacity to draw out 
the children to play with her. 

Rajmata Saroj Devi of Nabha gave me a golden retriever (male). 
Indira named him “Siraba” after a dog of that name she had as a 
little girl. Simba grew up too much attached to me and refused to go 
up to Lassie and the children except while I was away in office. He 
was not destined to stay long in the Prime Minister’s House. One 
morning he jumped on U Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, while passing 
through the corridor, in front of my study, to his bedroom in the 
Prime Minister’s House where he was staying as a guest. The same 
day I despatched Simba to a doctor in Faridabad who had an eye on 
him for a couple of months. 

Soon Lassie met with a sad fate. Early one morning the sweeper, 
unknown to anyone, took her out of the grounds of the Prime 
Minister’s House to his own quarters where he had to attend to some 
personal work. On returning to the Prime Minister’s House, Lassie 
was run over by a truck at the gate and killed. The children were 
desolate. Every one in the house from the Prime Minister downwards 
was sad and attended Lassie’s burial. 

I bought a golden retriever puppy (female) from a breeder in 
Hoshiarpur in 1955. Indira was not well when the puppy came. So 
the puppy had to remain with me for a couple of weeks. She 
wouldn’t sleep at night except on my bed. And I was not used to 
frequent turning and tossing during sleep. So sound sleep was denied 
to me for two weeks. I had to put up with it. When Indira got well. 



Of Animals and Children, Flowers and Plants

she took over the puppy and gave it a Russian name — Pepita Nichivo. 
She was called Pepi for short. 

Soon a friend in Simla popularly known as “Kutha Maharaj"’ sent 
me a fluffy male golden retriever puppy. He looked beautiful and 
adorable. It so happened that Indira was unwell when he also arrived. 
So I had to put up with the new puppy sleeping on my bed for a 
couple of weeks. We all thought that the new puppy would ultimately 
be a mate for Pepi. But Pepi turned hostile the moment she saw the 
puppy and bit him. Once she bit the puppy in the presence of Nehru 
who got angry with me for not making Pepi friendly with Puppy. 
I said I knew nothing about animal training. “The important thing 
is; have you tried?” asked Nehru. 

The next day was a Sunday. That afternoon I spent in my bed- 
room with Pepi and puppy, trying hard to make them friends. Puppy 
was willing and eager, but Pepi was difficult. Then my tea came. I 
gave a biscuit to Pepi and none to puppy. I gave Pepi another biscuit 
and ignored puppy even though he mewed and yelled. I continued 
to fondle Pepi at the expense of puppy. Thus Pepi understood that 
puppy was neither taking away her food nor my affection from her. 
She then quietly approached puppy and licked him on his face. Just 
at that time Nehru came to my room and was pleased at what he 
saw. He took both of them out on the lawn to play. 

Indira named puppy “Madhu.” Pepi and Madhu became famous 
as Nehru’s dogs, and two of the most photographed ones. 

Pepi and Madhu liked nothing better than being taken out for 
hunting squirrels. On Sunday afternoons the children and I used to 
take them out for the hunt. Once a squirrel ran and climbed a small 
tree. The children shook the tree and the squirrel jumped. Pepi made 
no mistake and ran away to the middle of the big central lawn with 
the squirrel in her mouth. She did not harm the squirrel and just 
wanted to play with it. She did so for some time. And lo! a kite 
swooped down and carried off the squirrel. Pepi was in a rage and 
continued to bark at the sky. Ever since then she would bark fiercely 
at any large flying bird including the crow. 

As Madhu grew up, it was discovered that he was a eunuch. But 
I have never seen a golden retriever so golden, so handsome and so 
big as Madhu. Indeed he looked leonine. Whenever Indira and I 
happened to be beyond the hearing distance of others, I used to call 
Madhu “Krishna” (Menon), and she used to call him “Feroze” 
(Gandhi). Madhu used to get rashes all over his body in summer. So 
he was usually sent to Raja Bhadri, Lieutenant Governor of Hima- 
chal Pradesh, at Simla for summer. Bhadri was a lover of dogs and 



12 


My Days with Nehru 

he had several. He told me that in Simla Madhu and a huge Alsation 
fought over a bitch. Madhu killed the Alsatian and mated the bitch 
with no result forthcoming. 

Pepi, after the age of three, was mated with S.K. Patil’s golden 
retriever. Pepi got her first and only litter in January 1959. Patil’s 
golden retriever later fought with an Alsatian at India Gate over a 
bitch — always the eternal triangle. Both Patil’s dog and the Alsatian 
died in the fight. Patil had the first pick from Pepi’s litter. 

After Indira moved to No. 1 Safdarjung Road, I saw Pepi and 
Madhu only once. They took my one hand each .in their mouths, 
then fell on their backs and cried. I felt immeasurably sad, and had 
them quitely taken away. They were old then. 

In the chapter “Rajiv and Sanjay” I have also referred to the 
two horses Bijli and Timbuctu. 

In the early fifties someone from Sikkim gave Nehru a beautiful 
male “Lesser Panda” (Himalayan cat bear). A little later a female 
panda was acquired. The male was named “Bhimsa” and the female 
“Tashi” — both Sikkimese names. A photograph of Nehru with 
Bhimsa appeared in my first book. Bhimsa was a playful extrovert 
eager to show off; but Tashi was shy, retiring and lady-like. They 
spent about six months of the year in Delhi in a specially constructed 
enclosure enveloping half of a grown-up tree, and the summer and 
rainy season in Naini Tal where some of the animals from the 
Lucknow Zoo were' transferred for the summer. Every morning, after 
breakfast, Nehru used to feed Bhimsa and Tashi and play with them. 
They were fed on milk with Quaker oats or rice, bamboo leaves, 
berries, fruits and sometimes a little honey. Nehru was somewhat 
rough with them. I once told him that they need not be put through 
the toughening process. He shut me up by saying that I did not know 
a thing about dealing with animals. I smiled and told him that the 
first thing needed was patience. 

One morning, after Nehru played with the pandas, Bhimsa escaped. 
In the afternoon he was located at the top of the tallest tree in the 
sprawling estate surrounding the Prime Minister’s House. The police 
attempt at rescuing him was so clumsy that it only frightened and 
infuriated the animal. When I returned from ofiice in the evening, 
the “rescue operation” with sticks and poles, net and beating of tin 
was still on. I asked every one to withdraw and go away. 1 brought 
milk in the bowl Bhimsa was used to and some bamboo leaves, 
Bhimsa watched these and me. I put them down and retreated to 
some distance away. Bhimsa, who was hungry by then, quietly came 
down and finished the food. Then he looked at me without suspicion 



Of Animals and Children, Flowers and Plants

and slowly walked back to his enclosure to join Tashi. 

Nehru got indisposed one day — a rare occurrence — and had to be 
confined to his bed-room. That morning he could neither feed the 
pandas nor play with them. At tea-time I locked up the dogs and 
went out to the enclosure of the pandas. Tashi wanted to be left alone; 
but Bhimsa came out at my calling him and followed me into the 
house, climbed the steps to go upstairs and on to Nehru’s bed-room 
through the long corridor. Bhimsa examined the room and scrutinized 
everything in it thoroughly. By that time I had handed over to Nehru 
a small bunch of bamboo branches with leaves. Bhimsa went up to 
Nehru, who was sitting up in a chair, and rubbed Nehru’s leg with 
his body. As he fed Bhimsa v.'hh the bamboo leaves, Nehru asked me: 
“How did you manage to bring him up all the way?” I said: “Patience, 
and not being rough with him!” He smiled and was very pleased that 
Bhimsa came. I took Bhimsa back to his enclosure and fondled him 
on the way. Then I went up and released the dogs. Pepi smelled me, 
sniffed and ran to Bhimsa’s enclosure and angrily barked at the 
pandas. 

Bhimsa and Tashi became indirectly responsible for generating 
hostility in-Sanjay towards me lasting for several weeks. Before break- 
fast on 1 April I rang up Sanjay on the internal telephone system 
and told him that Tashi had given birth to two baby pandas and that 
Bhimsa was guarding them. Off he ran outside in great excitement 
only to meet with disappointment. He got furious and came racing 
calling me names. As he exhausted all the naughty words in his 
vocabulary, I told him: “You are no better than the Kerala bumpkin 
boy who, when told that an ox had given birth to a calf, ran out to 
see the calf.” He did not like the story either. By then it was breakfast- 
time, and he went up in a rage. At the breakfast table he bitterly 
complained against me to “Mummie” and “Nana”; but they pointed 
out to him that 1 April was All Fools Day and explained to him its 
background. Sanjay also complained about the story of the .ox, the 
calf and the Kerala bumpkin boy. 

Nehru was presented with several tiger and leopard cubs caught 
by villagers mostly in Madhya Pradesh. They were either abandoned 
by their mothers or orphaned by cruel poachers. These cubs were 
invariably kept in enclosure in the grounds of the Prime Minister’s 
House until they were about six months old and then given away to 
the New Delhi Zoo. Nehru would put on gloves and play with them 
v/henever he could find time. 

Nikita Khrushchev sent to Nehru, as a gift, a strikingly handsome 
horse — a young black stallion. I was very frisky. Nehru was anxious 



14 


My Days with Nehru 

to ride the horse; but we contrived to prevent it as the horse happened 
■ to be an uncontroiable one. The horse was handed over to the army 
for its stud farm. The King of Saudi Arabia presented two beautiful 
grey Arab mares. I have never seen such elegant animals. These too 
were handed over to the army. 

President Rajendra Prasad told the Prime Minister that he would 
like to keep an elephant in the Rashtrapati Bhavan estate. Nehru cau- 
tioned against it though he did not object. The President managed to 
get an elephant and asked his body-guard to look aftei it. The 
elephant did not take much time to come into musth. It started creat- 
ing terror and havoc in the entire estate. Ultimately the animal had 
to be shot dead. 

Nehru followed the example of Aurangzeb and sent many elephants 
to zoos all over the world for the benefit of children. 

A goose and a gander were kept in the grounds of the Prime 
Minister’s House for some time. They became a menace as they star- 
ted bitting innocent children and women who came to the house. 
They had to be disposed of. 

Sanjay wanted to rear some ducks. So we bought some duck’s eggs 
and a brooding hen to incubate the eggs. When the eggs were hatch- 
ed and the ducklings came out, both the hen and Sanjay put on an 
air of triumph. For some days the hen and the ducklings were not let 
out. Then one day the hen proudly walked out into the grounds 
where the ducklings saw the lily pond. Immediately they made a 
beeline for the pond and enjoyed themselves to the utter dismay and 
consternation of the hen and the delight of Sanjay. All the cackling 
of the hen warning of danger of drowning in the pond had no effect 
on the ducklings. 1 explained to Sanjay that the hen and the crow 
were unsuspecting foolish birds; the ducks cheated the hen and the 
cuckoo cheated the crow. 1 did not, of course, tell Sanjay what 
Bernard Shaw said in this connection: “A bachelor is either a hermit 
or a cuckoo.” 1 thought that Shaw should have applied it to spinsters 
also. 

Sanjay loved to listen to stories. As a little boy he offered to give 
me all his pocket-money if I told him one story a day. 1 tried to 
oblige him; but often I ran out of stories and I let him keep his 
pocket-money. Sanjay was fascinated by the story of a naughty boy 
who made a brooding hen sit on a dozen white round stones of the 
size of eggs. The boy had collected the stones from a river bed. The 
hen sat on the stones for 25 days and nothing happened. She grew 
suspicious, got out and fiercely pecked at the stones, made a lot

of angry noises and ran away. Sanjay made me repeat this story to 
him three times. 

In London someone gave Nehru a Begonia plant in a small pot 
from a green-house. In the plane, while returning to India he would 
frequently ask; “Has that plant been watered?” On arrival in Delhi it 
was transferred to a larger pot and kept in the shade. Sometimes in 
the midst of something important he would remember the Begonia 
and ask me: “Has that plant been watered?” I had to tell him that it 
was replanted in a larger pot with fresh manure, was regularly 
watered and, true to its reputation, it had grown putting on coloured 
leaves of “elephant's ears and angel’s wings.” 1 assured him that I 
was having a look at the plant almost daily. But 1 never heard the 
last about the plant until one day I brought in the pot with the plant 
full of pink flowers. 

As was my practice wherever I stayed, planted a large number of 
flowering trees and shrubs as well as fruit trees in the Prime Minister’s 
House estate, including three choice date palms Irom Saudi Arabia 
which that country seldom allowed to be exported. Nehru liked 
phalsa juice. So I planted a large area with pbalsa which did very 
well and yielded masses of succulent berries. The flowering trees I 
planted included not only several scarlet-coloured Flame of the 
Forest, which Indira was fond of, but also two yellow-flowering 
Dhak (flame of the forest) which I got from Shantiniketan, besides 
some shrubs from Kerala such as the wild-growing ixora. 1 even tried 
to grow a couple of coconut trees, but they could not survive the dry 
heat and the cold winter. 

In the Prime Minister’s House estate I developed a rose garden of 
my own. I got plants from England^ Germany, Poland, France and 
Italy and some excellent Indian varieties. Nehru was a man who 
hated wasting anything. He used to put into a cigarette tin what came 
out of his electric shaving machine every day. He would hand over to 
me the tin when it was full and ask me to use it as manure for roses. 
I used to apply it to those plants which produced perfect buds. I 
wanted to grow banksia rose, but Dr B.P. Pal, the agriculture scien- 
tist and noted rosarian. discouraged me. He said it won’t survive the 
Delhi summer. However 1 did not give up. Some years later 1 brought 
a few cuttings from Almora. Two ol them germinated but only one 
survived. I planted it at the foot of a Jacaranda tree at No. 2 Presi- 
dent’s Estate where it flourished and flowered every spring. It must 
be still there. From it I reproduced a plant and gave it to my good 
friend Billy Badhwar who is a keen gardner, a naturalist and a con- 
servationist. ’Whenever the name of Dr B.P. Pal occurs to me I

My Days with Nehra 

invariably remember Professor Harold Laski’s essay on “the limita- 
tion of the expert.” 

, A story was given currency about Nehru and the rose by Nehru’s 
sister Krishna Hutheesing. She wrote a nasty piece on Nehru in the 
American magazine ifli/zes’ .fiTome Jowmo/. Among other things she 
mentioned three points: (1) office coarsened Nehru, (2) Nehru was 
over-fond of puddings, and (3) wearing of the rose in the button-hole 
of his achkan became a practice after a beautiful young woman 
started sending him a rose daily. I had items (2) and (3) contradicted 
by Vincent Sheean, the noted author and esteemed contributor of the 
Ladies Home Journal which published it prominently in the form of a 
letter to the editor. Vincent Sheean had quoted me as his authority. 
Krishna Hutheesing was furious. She wrote to me the nastiest letter 
I have ever seen. I tore it off and put it into the waste paper basket, 
and sent her a three- word reply “Go to Hell.” She threatened to 
forward it to Nehru. I again replied, “Go to Hell.” Wisdom dawned 
on her at last and she did not carry out her threat. I wished she had. 

Nehru was never overfond of puddings. In fact he did not care 
for them. I cannot think of anything more absurd than Krishna 
Hutheesing’s assertion that office coarsened Nehru. He was too sensi- 
tive and refined a person to be coarsened. And what is more, he was 
bigger than any office he held. 

The beautiful young woman Krishna Hutheesing had in mind was 
Mridula Sarabhai who was far from beautiful. Nor did Mridula 
know the difference between a cabbage and a rose. 

Nehru liked long-pointed rose buds for his button-hole. A number 
of them were placed on his dressing table every morning by the malt 
in a small vase for him to choose. He changed the buds generally 
three times daily. There is no romance attached to the rose in so far 
as Nehru was concerned. The rose in India, indeed everywhere, is 
beautiful and Nehru was a lover of beauty. 

I had expected Congressmen in the Indian Parliament to start a 
“Red Rose League,” as the British Conservative MPs started the 
“Primrose League” almost immediately after the death of Disraeli 
whose favourite flower was the primrose. To India Nehru meant 
infinitely more than what Disraeli meant to Britian. But it is futile to 
expect imagination from Indian politicians or to associate them with 
anything beautiful.

Ever since man appeared on earth, he had been fascinated and over- 
awed by the universe with its stars and planets and other “heavenly 
bodies.” Aitrology is the ancient “art” or “science’’ of divining the 
fate and future of human beings from indications given by the posi- 
tions of stars and other heavenly bodies. The study of astrology and 
the belief in ft, as part of astronomy, is found in a developed form 
among the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians. Starting with the 
belief that man’s life and happiness are largely dependent upon the 
phenomena in the heavens, that the fertility of the soil is dependent 
on the sun.shining in the heavens, as well as upon the rains that come 
from heaven, that on the other hand the mischief and damage done 
by storms and floods, to both of which the valley of the Euphrates 
was almost regularly subject, were to be traced to the heavens, the 
conclusion was drawn in ancient Babylon and Assyria that all great 
Gods had their seats in the heavens. Astrology spread from Babylon 
to Greece about the middle of the 4th century b.c., and reached 
Rome before the beginning of the Christian era. In India and China 
astronomy and astrology largely reflect Greek theories and specula- 
tions; and similarly, with the introduction of Greek culture into 
Europe, both astronomy and astrology were actively cultivated in the 
region of the Nile during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Astro- 
logy was further developed by the Arabs from the 7th to the 13th cen- 
tury, and in Europe the 14th and 15th centuries astrologers were 
dominating influences at court. 

In China palmistry is said to have existed 3,000 years before Christ, 
and in Greek literature it is treated even in the most ancient writings 
as well-known belief. Now it is practised in nearly all parts of China. 
It is also extensively practised in India. It is probably from their. ori- 
ginal Indian home that the traditional fortune telling of the gipsies 
has been derived. 

It was in India that Cheiro perfected his trace as an astrologer- 
palmist. 

Louis XIII of France had an astrologer who was an avaricious 
man. He had committed several crimes in the pursuit of money. He 
wielded considerable influence on the King. Cardinal Richelieu dis- 



18 


My Days with Nehru 

liked the astrologfer and wanted to eliminate him from access to the 
court. He built up a formidable case against the astrologer and sub- 
mitted the file to the King recommending his execution. The King 
sent for the astrologer and told him; ‘‘You have predicted many things 
most of which have come true; but you have not made any prediction 
about your own death.” The astrologer was intrigued. He said; “Your 
Majesty, I have predicted my death, but I felt it prudent not to tell 
anyone.” “Why so,” the King asked. The astrologer said; “Your 
Majesty, my death will occur a week before your Majesty’s.” The 
Ring fell into deep thought. Recovering, the King said: “1 Luve before 
me a file from my government listing your crimes and misdeeds and 
asking for your execution; I give you a last chance. Any re 7 ;etition will 
earn you life-imprisonment.” The King returned the file to Cardinal 
Richelieu intimating that the last warning had been administered to 
the offender. Then the King hastened to send for his Ch?.mberlain and 
instructed him to look after the astrologer’s comforts ^vith great care 
and ordered that food and wine from his own table should be served 
to the astrologer. 

In modern times no people are under the influence of astrology and 
palmistry as the Indians from the villages to the nation’s capital. 
Muhoortam (auspicious time) is invariably determined by pandits and 
astrologers for every marriage or important ceremony. Before a 
marriage is decided, the horoscopes of the boy and girl are examined 
by astrologers and pandits to determine compafi.bility as is done in 
regard to “blood groups” in several Western cotintries. In some parts 
of India no one will get out of his house durinf; Rahu-Kaalam which 
extends to 90 minutes daily during day-time. ! ■ 

Early in the fifties Dr Sampurnanand, who /vvas a remarkable char- 
acter in many ways, wrote to Nehru about astrology suggesting that 
he should stop making fun of it publicly. Nehru replied to say that he 
did not wish to ridicule astrology but that it was a dangerous thing for 
people to condition their minds on the basis of astrological predictions. 

Two men, who were abject slaves to a;itfology, palmistry and even 
black-magic, were President Rajendra Prasad and Minister Gulzarilal 
Nanda. Rajendra Prasad’s favourite astrologers predicted emphatically 
that he would step down from the Presidency and become the Prime 
Minister. Barkis was willing but peggatty did not oblige. Nanda, who 
wasted much time on havans pujas and other futilities, was told 
by his astrologers that be would become the Prime Minister. In a sense 
the prediction came true when he act^ as the Prime Minister for a 
few days, each time twice — alter the death of Nehru and after the 
death of Lai Bahadur. At the time of the formal election of the leader

19 


of the Congress Party in Parliament after the death of Nehru, Acting 
Prime Minister Nanda made a momentous announcement to a small 
group of friends: “I am going to sacrifice myself.” This came as a 
great disappointment to most Congress MPs as they felt they were de- 
prived of an opportunity to sacrifice him. 

Most ministers and members of Parliament subjected themselves to 
the influence of astrologers and fortune-tellers in varying degrees. The 
astrologers and other fortune-tellers had their field day on several oc- 
casions when harvesting was plentiful — the time of distributing party 
tickets, election time, the time of formation of governments, and res- 
huffles of government — apart from the never-ending continuous pro- 
cess. Government officials were not immune from the influence of 
astrology. Apart from astrologers and other fortune-tellers, there 
exists in at least three places — Madras, Meerut and Hoshiarpur — 
Nadis containing a large number of significant horoscopes and their 
readings inscribed on very old palmyrah leaves which are frequently 
consulted by believers. 

T.T. Krishnamachari was somewhat of an amateur astrologer; the 
great scientist. Dr K S. Krishnan, who was soft-spoken, erudite, cul- 
tured and a delightful person, whom I knew well and admired, was a 
believer in astrology even though he never went to an astrologer for 
predictions about himself. His interest was largely intellectual. To the 
end he had an inquiring mind. 

During the time of the Chinese aggression, astrologers and sooth- 
sayers were working overtime. All kinds of rumours were set afloat 
about the government and the fate of Nehru. At that time there 
appeared on the scene a weird man from Bihar with his black magic. 
Rajendra Prasad used to be one of his customers. This time he was 
brought to Delhi in great secrecy by another Bihari who had retired as 
the Governor of a state and was staying in Delhi where he possessed 
a house. The late Maharaja Yadavendra Singh of Patiala became the 
patron of the weird man with the help of the former Governor. One 
item of black-magic was that a pencil would get up in the dark and 
write answers to questions. Most of the questions happened to be 
about Nehru and the answers were to suit the predilections of the 
questioners. After one sitting the Maharaja, who always had foolish 
political ambitions which, he thought, could be achieved in an under 
hand manner and with the help of money, decided to invite a care- 
fully selected group of top army brass and expose them to this black- 
magic. I received authentic information about it. I went to Nehru and 
suggested that Home Minister Lai Bahadur might be asked to get rid 
of the black-magic man from Delhi at once. I disclosed to him the 



20 


My Days with Nehru 

source of my information. Nehru sent for Lai Bahadur and, in my 
presence, conveyed the information to him. Lai Bahadur had to act 
swiftly, and he did. At the appointed time Maharaja Yadvendra 
Singh, his army friends and the former Governor could find no trace of 
the black-magic man. Little did they know at that time that their man 
was in a train, under police escort, bound for Patna with instructions 
to keep off Delhi for six months. 

Indira always believed in astrology. One evening in the mid-fifties 
Nehru left office rathej- early and drove straight to Maulana Azad’s 
house where he told me that I might go home and send back the car 
for him within half an' hour. When I arrived in the Prime Minister’s 
House, Indira happened to be downstairs. Noticing that I had arrived 
alone, she stopped the car. She looked somewhat agitated and told me- 
“The whole day I had been worried about what Papu’s horoscope .says 
— that one of his legs will be disabled. I am troubled about the possi- 
bility of a minor car accident. Your being with him is a comfort for 
me. Now you have left him and come back. I wish you would go back 
to him.” Without any argument 1 left and waited in the Maulana’s 
house. Nehru was annoyed at my wasting time waiting for him. On the 
drive back to the Prime Minister’s house, I had to tell him the rea- 
son why he found me in the Maulana’s bouse. He asked me: “Why did 
you listen to her bilge? You should have laughed it away.” Inciden- 
tally, the prediction proved right. One of Nehru’s legs was disabled, 
and he had to drag on one foot; but it was not due to any accident 
but the result of a stroke. 

On 6 August 1967, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit wrote to me from 
Dehra Dun enclosing a newspaper clipping containing a report of 
some predictions about Indira by the amateur astrologer K.G. Datta, 
The predictions were inferences drawn from the interaction of the 
personal horoscopes of the “dramatis personae.” They were: 

(1) V,V, Giri would emerge as India’s man of the people to win 
the election for Presidentship. 

(2) Indira Gandhi would endure several threats to her position 
for the next 18 months (from August 1967) and would remain at 
the helm of affairs till May 1982. 

(3) Friction within the political structure would cause it to dis- 
integrate during the next 12 months (from August 1967). Many 
heads of those above 55 years would roll before stability is finally 

■ attained. 

The prediction about Indira being at the helm of affairs till May 



Stranglehold of Astrology 


21 


1982 disturbed Vijaya Lakshmi. Considerable credence was attached 
to this prediction because K.G. Datta had, in November 1961, correc- 
tly predicted the fall of the Labour Government in Britain, landslides 
in Chile, and bloodshed in NEFA; he had also foretold Nehru’s 
death “before 30 May 1964” and also Lai Bahadur’s death. Vijaya 
Lakshmi must have heaved a sigh of relief in March/April 1977 at 
Datta’s prediction going wrong about Indira. Astrologers have the 
peculiar capacity to unsettle people temporarily. Sometimes they give 
the credulous temporary hope too. 

In 1963 a Tamil Christian, known to me personally, met Indira in 
New Delhi. He, like Cheiro, is an astrologer-palmist. He was in 
Ceylon for some time and had correctly predicted the assassination of 
Prime Minister Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandarnaike. This pre- 
diction was known to several people. Immediately after the assassina- 
tion, he feared for his life and managed to leave Ceylon. The Madras 
friend, svho renounced his religion, but not the booze, and reverted to 
Hinduism for the sake of his trade, showed me the note book in which 
the impression of Indira’s autograph at the bottom of the page. His 
prediction was that within three years Indira would be the Prime 
Minister. From then on the astrologer-palmist was a frequent visitor 
to Delhi. He soon got on to L.N. Misbra who was a pathetic victim of 
any astrologer who passed by. Gradually the astrologer-palmist began 
to wield considerable influence over Mishra who would bend low to 
touch his feet. And the astrologer-palmist became a contact man for 
several businessmen and was constantly in Delhi living in expensive 
hotels and imbibing more than was good for him. The astrologer- 
palmist had a roaring time financially until the death of Mishra. He 
also kept in touch with Indira. 

In the spring of 1970, egged on by L.N. Mishra and Dinesh Singh, 
Indira frantically sent for the astrologer-palmist from Madras. On 
arrival in Delhi, he saw everyone perturbed at reports of several astro- 
logers who had predicted dire things for Indira and had given publici- 
ty for them. The astrologer-palmist consulted his note book and gave 
a bold prediction that Indira would remain firmly in power till 1977. 
Mishra and Dinesh Singh called several newsmen to meet the astro- 
loger-palmist who broke the good news to them. The prediction was 
prominently published by newspapers all over India. I saw it in the 
Hindustan Times and the Statesman in New Delhi in their issues of 
10 May 1970. The stock of the astrologer-palmist rose sky-high with 
those “who mattered” in Delhi. And his income through various 
sources also went up beyond his expectations. It did not take long for 
him to build a large house in Madras and to set up a prrinting press 



22 


My Days with Nehru 

for his son. He deserved a]] these because of his successive predic- 
tions about Indira both of which came true. 

Indira’s long-distance contact with the Madras astrologer-palmist 
was MaragathamChandrashekhar. She was the first Special Envoy of 
the Prime Minister. 

The rnarriage of the astrologer-palmist's daughter took place in 
Madras in May 1972. At the functions Indira was represented by the 
ubiquitous Yashpal Kapoor. The Governor of Madras and his Cabi- 
net were dutifully present. The same evening Indira landed at the 
Meenambakkam airport where she greeted the newly married couple 
and gave the astrologer-palmist a present of Rs 10,000. L.N. Mishra 
sent a much bigger amount. 

The astrologer-palmist accompanied Indira twice to the ancient 
Devi Temple at Kanya Kumari. It was at his instance that Indira sent 
through L.N. Mishra a golden crown studded with precious stones for 
the Devi at the Kanya Kumari Temple. The astrologer-palmist is a 
devotee of the Kanya Kumari Temple and also the Tirupali Temple 
which has also been visited by Indira more than once. 

During the Emergency the astrologer-palmist lost touch with Indira. 
Her entourage put him off whenever he tried to see her. He was to 
discover later that an astrologer called Shastri had appeared on the 
scence. 

After the death of Mishra the stars of the astrologer-palmist were 
not on the “ascendant.” Bussinessmen slowly deserted him. Once he 
was arrested in Madras by the police on a complaint from a Delhi 
hotel for non-payment of bills. What happened was that the business- 
man concerned refused to pay the bills because the astrologer- palmist 
failed to fulfill his promise of getting his business done. 

The last time the astrologer-palmist met Indira was in April 1977 
after her defeat at the elections. He found her shattered and desolate. 
She complained that he had not seen her for a long time. He exp'ain- 
ed to her that her staff had thwarted his many attempts to meet her. 
She said that what had happened was totally unexpected and that no- 
body had predicted it. He reminded her of his prediction in 1970 that 
she would be Prime Minister till 1977 and showed her the relevant 
newspaper clippings. She asked him to visit the house at 12 Willing- 
don Crescent, to which she was going to shift, and do some yuja and 
say some prayers in the room in which she was going to stay. He did 

it dutifully and returned to Madras. 

Now the astrologer-palmist sits in Madras complaining that Indira 
discarded him and took the advice of the astrologer called Shastn and 
ordered election. According to the Madras astrologer-palmist, Shastn, 


Stranglehold of Astrology 


23 


who is a hoax, assured Indira that she would get 350 seats in Parlia- 
ment. The astrologer palmist chants two things now; (1) Vinasa Kalay 
Viparita Biidln, and (2) “when God decides to destroy a woman, He 
first makes her mad.” 

Wearing of riidraksha mala and visiting the temples by Indira were 
a part of her faith in astrology. When she said some time ago publicly 
that she was wearing the riidraksha mala on the advice of V.K. 
Krishna Menon, I could not help laughing. Any way she had lost cre- 
dibility in 1958 in so far as I am concerned. Apart from that, I doubt 
if Krishna Menon knew what a riidraksha mala was. He was to a very 
large extent a de-nationalized person. 

Cicero, Savonarola and La Fontaine were pronounced opponents 
of astrology. In England Jonathan Swift, the British satirist, is credit- 
ed with having given the death-blow to astrology. In January 1708 
Swift, under the name of Isaac Bickerstaff, issued a solemn prediction 
that the notorious almanac maker John Pattridge would die at 1 1 p.m. 
on 29 March, and on 30 March he published a letter confirming this 
prophecy. Pattridge’s fatuous denial and reply to Bickerstaff elicited 
Swift’s amusing “Vindication of Isaac Bickerstaff Esq” in 1709. The 
episode left a permanent trace in literature, for, when in 1709, Steels 
was to start the Tatler, it occurred to him that he could secure the 
public ear in no surer way than by adopting the same of “Bickerstaff” 
associated with the most amusing hoaxes ever perpertrated against the 
quackery of astrologers. 

In spite of Jonathan Swift, astrology lingered and later flourished 
in Great Britain. The great poet Lord Byron (1788-1824) was a believer 
in omens and astrology. While he was a young boy, an English sooth- 
sayer by the name of Mrs Williams had predicted that he would die 
after completing 36 years of age. And that is exactly what happened. 
A British “learned journal” published that in 1968 there were 5,C00 
astrologers in England and that their number was increasing 5'ear by 
year. In 1968 some of the top ones in England were earning as much 
as 30,000 pounds a year. Much progress must have occured since 
1968. 

Time magazine dated 21 March 1969 published an article about 
astrology in the United States. There were then 10,000 full-time and 
175,000 part-time astrologers in the United States. Like almost every- 
thing else in the United States, astrology was being computarized. A 
company called Time Pattern Research Institute Inc had programmed 
a computer to turn out 10,000-word horoscope readings in two 
minutes; it expected to be doing 10,000 such readings in June 1969. 
Carrol Richter, the doyen of America’s professional astrologers, had 



24 


My Days wiih Nehru 


a byline that was carried by 306 newspapers each week-day into some 
30 million American homes. His annual earnings were well into six 
figures in dollars. Since the Tune magazine wrote in 1969, further 
strides must have taken place in the United Slates in the realm of 
astrology. 

Many Americans and other westerners believed that India was a 
land of astrology and of snakes. Time magazine and some British 
journals have enlightened them about astrology. In so far as snakes are 
concerned, Armand Denis, the noted naturalist, has stated in his fas- 
cinating book On Safari: “The United States are a shake collector’s 
paradise and there are probably more snakes per square mile in New 
York state than in any tropical area of the world.” 

An interesting astrologer lived in Switzerland early in the present 
century. One day a middle aged man, with a long face full of worries, 
approached this astrologer. The astrologer looked at his chart and 
palm and told the man that he had financial worries, health problems 
andTamiiy troubles; and that these would continue till the age of fifty. 
The man was nearly 49 and was quite prepared to go through his 
ordeal for a little more than a year. In great expectation he asked the 
astrologer the question, “and after that?” The astrologer coolly repli- 
ed: “After that you will get used to it.” 



4 A Visit to the Soviet Union 


After the din and dust surrounding my resignation from the government 
was over in May 1959 I went abroad spending six weeks in the Soviet 
Union in two instalments, on my way to Europe and London and on 
my way back to India. On both occasions 1 stayed at our embassy in 
Moscow as the personal guest of Ambassador K.P.S. Menon and his 
remarkable wife whom I always called “Amma” (mother). For purely 
personal reasons of my own, I did not accompany Nehru on his visit 
to the Soviet Union. In a sense I preferred a private visit to a conduct- 
ed one. KPS arranged for me to visit several places in and around 
Moscow. 1 also visited Yesnaya Polyana (the place where Tolstoy 
lived), Kiev and Leningrad. 

During the first leg of my stay in Moscow, the British Labour Party 
leader Hugh Gaitskell and Aneurin (Nye) Bevan were there on oflBcial 
invitation. Before leaving Delhi, I had received a communication 
from Nye to say that he would like to come to lunch with me at the 
embassy in Moscow and had expressed a preference for light Indian 
food not highly spiced. Soon after his arrival in Moscow, Nye rang 
me up and fixed the date for the lunch. The day before the lunch, 
KPS fell ill and had to go to a nursing home. As it invariably 
happens with this long-married couple, so terribly devoted to each 
other, Amma also developed some ailment, real or imagined, and went 
with KPS to the nursing home. The only other sophisticated couple, 
married for so long and still so terribly in love with each other, I have 
come across, were Sir Lewis Casson and Dame Sybil Thorndike. 

Nye was late for- lunch. He said that Khrushchev was in high spirits 
and kept on talking. He said that after the launching of the Sputnik, 
Khrushchev was obsessed with the power and grandeur of the Soviet 
Union and kept on saying that the future lay with the Soviet Union and 
not with the United States. Nye also told me about his visit to a school 
specially arranged by the Soviet authorities at his request. He had 
brought with him a young naturalized British citizen of Polish origin 
who knew Russian very well. Nj'e had always felt that it was unwise 
to depend on Soviet interpreters. So he and his interpreter descended 
on the school with which they were very impressed — about the 
teachers who W’ere all women, the curriculum, and amenities of 



26 


My Days with Nehru 

various kinds. He asked the teacher of a class of about 30 students if 
he could ask them some questions individually. The teacher agreed. 
With the help of the interpreter, he started asking his questions— what 
the name of the father was and what his job was. Nye d;sco\’ercd that 
it was an exclusive school for the new elite, not a “neighbourhood 
school” for all. All the students were the children of people high up 
in the party heirarchy or of top technical and business executives of 
government industrial and commercial undertakings. Not a worker’s 
child was there. 

At Yasnaya Polyana I was deeply impressed by the simple mound 
of earth beautifully grassed over the place, where Tolstoy was hurried 
— the grave of his horse nearby. This simple monument fits in elo- 
quently with the style of living during the last phase of Tolstoy’s life. 

I came away with the thought of how much money we in India waste; 
on monuments of no particular artistic value. In some vva 3 's I am an 
admirer of Nana Fadnavis. He was a munificent patron of art but a 
very discriminating one. I wish we had one like him now in India to 
deal with the monstrosities that are put up and regarded as works of 
art. For example, there is a statue of Asaf Ali recently put up in Delhi. 
It is so small that Asaf Ali, in his achkan, looks like a doll-like girl in 
frock. 

On Nana Fadnavis’ evening drive in a horse-drawn carriage, a man 
threw himself before the carriage and narrowly escaped being hoofed 
to death, Nana Fadnavis questioned him. He said he had perfected 
an art after 12 years of hard work. He had to spend another year by 
going from pillar to post to obtain an audience with Nana Fadnavis 
in order to show him what he had perfected. The virtual ruler of the 
Marathas promptly allowed him an audience. Fifteen minutes before 
the appointed time, the “artist” arrived with a small silk screen on a 
stand, a tiny bowl of raw rice and an empty bowl. The screen had a 
small hole in the centre. He arranged the screen placing the empty 
bowl in front of it in such a way that he could not see it. He sat with 
the bowl of raw rice six feet away. Nana Fadnavis arrived with his 
retinue and gave the signal to the “artist” to demonstrate. He took 
the rice grains from the bowl and threw them effortlessly one by one., 
each went through the tiny hole in the screen and landed in the empty 
bowl. When the demonstration was over, the whole audience rose an ii 
applauded. They felt certain that Nana Fadnavis would bestow on the 
“artist” ajagir in recognition. Nana Fadnavis got up and ordered, 
“take him away and give him a bowl of cooked rice, a man \/ho 
wasted 13 years of his precious life on this futility deserves nothing 

better. ’ 



A Visit to the Soviet Union

If ever I get a chance to come face to face with the Almighty, I 
would like to ask him why he tortured two of the world’s greatest and 
noblest men — Socrates and Tolstoy — with selfish nagging wives. Con- 
fucious deserved what his wife did to him — she left him because he 
was such an inconsiderate, insufferable, and demanding dandy. 

Before leaving for the Soviet Union, I had heard that “tips” had 
been abolished in that country as a decadent burgoise practice and 
that Moscow was the cheapest capital in the world for a hair-cut 
(equivalent to one rupee while it was Rs li in any of the hair-cutting 
saloons in New Delhi). During the first leg of my stay in Moscow, 
KPS Menon’s Personal Secretary took me out for a hair-cut. Much 
to his dislike, 1 insisted on walking to a tall multi-storeyed building, 
not far away from the embassy, the ground floor of which was a hair- 
cutting saloon and the upper portions were residential flats in one of 
which premier ballerina Ulanova lived. After the hair-cut I saw KPS 
Menon’s Secretary handing over to the Russian hair-cutter of the 
“Public Sector Enterprise” the equivalent of a little more than five 
rupees. 1 was furious; but I kept my cool. While walking back, I ques- 
tioned the young man. He told me; “Sir, you are here for a few weeks; 
1 am going to be here for another two years. Unless 1 tipped the hair- 
cutler, the next time I come here, he will ignore me, and make me 
come several times and finally the embassy may have to enlist the 
assistance of the Protocol Divison of the Soviet Foreign Office before 
I can get a hair-cut!” Abolition of tips in the Soviet Union amounts 
to no more than the constitutional abolition of untouchability in India. 
They are all in the minds of men. The acquisitive instinct in man can 
never be blotted out completely. I do hope that India will never 
nationalize the barber trade. 

KPS told me that long-playing records were very cheap in Moscow 
and that I might buy a set of records of the music of Swan Lake by 
the famous Bolshoi Theatre conductor; and he lent me the money for 
it. Alfred Gonsalves, the First Secretary of the embassy, who knew 
Russian very well, took me to GUM, Moscow’s new department 
store which compares favourably with any in western Europe, 
England, or the United States, except in its contents. GUM was 
opened with great fanfare on the day Beria was shot, to divert people’s 
attention. 

At a particular counter at the GUM I noticed a couple of suspi- 
cious characters coming and going and whispering to the salesman. I 
asked Alfred about it. Retold me: “Many products are in short supply. 
When stocks of such products arrive, the management displays, for 
public information, bill-boards, about such arrivals. There is a rush 



28 


My Days with Nehru 

for buying and several people succeed. Then there will be an anno- 
uncement that stocks have been sold out. Smart chaps will linger on, 
approach the salesman when there is nobody around, place a few 
rubles under the counter and get away with the stuff.” Corruption 
started when man appeared on earth and it will last until life is extin- 
guished in the planet. Corruption, like diabetes, can never be cured: 
it can only be controlled. 

Alfred Gonsalves also took me for a short ride in the Metro. 
Moscow Metro is famous for its lavish splendur and cleanliness. He 
told me a story about how Russians react to inconvenient questions. 
A group of American engineers visited the much-advertised fabulous 
Moscow Metro soon after its construction was complete and where 
vastly impressed by the extravagant use of marble and decor. They 
anxiously waited for the train; but none came as the service had not 
actually started. In their impatience the Americans tauntingly asked 
their Russian counterparts: “But, where are the trains?” The Russians 
were annoyed and asked the Americans a counter-question: “How 
about the Negro question?” The American were dumb founded. 

I visited an “Open Market” in Moscow where peasants, mostly 
women, who had taken advantage of Khrushchev’s policy of relaxa- 
tion by allowing them a limited area to cultivate their own vegetables 
and fruits and rear chicken, pigs etc. and sell them wherever they 
liked, brought their produce to sell to whoever was prepared to pay 
the maximum. The lively haggling which was going on reminded me 
of a varitable fish market — which I do not decry. 

I visited a state farm and a collective farm and listened to all the 
lectures interspersed with statistics mostly expressed in terms of percen- 
tages which I view with suspicion. When somebody tells me that pro- 
duction of natural rubber in the Soviet Union rose by 2,000 per cent 
in 1959 since the “Great October Revolution,” I would like to know 
what exactly was the production of natural rubber before the “Great 
October Revolution.” Was it five pounds crudely extracted and pro- 
cessed from a single tree in a botanical garden in the extreme south of 
the Soviet Union? There is some truth in the saying: “There are three 
kinds of lies in the world— the lie; the black lie; and statistics”! Only 
a scientist with great mental integrity can correctly employ and pro- 
perly interpret statistics. 

While I visited the state farm and the collective farm, I contem- 
plated on the background ofthese institutions in historical perspective. ' 
And what Winston Churchill wrote in his famous book. The Second 
World War— Volume IV {The Hinge of Fate) came forcibly to my mind. 

I quote below the relevent extract from the book: 



A Visit to the Soviet Union 


29 


Moscow, 15th August 1942 

Dinner to Winston Churchill at the Kremlin by Marshal Joseph 
Stalin 

It is now past midnight, and Cadogan had not appeared with the 
draft of the communique. 

“Tell me, “I asked, “have the stresses of this war been as bad 
to you personally as carrying through the policy of the collective 
farms?” 

This subject immediately roused the Marshal. 

“Oh, no,” he said, “the Collective Farm Policy was a terrible 
struggle." ’ 

“I thought you would have found it bad,” said I, “because you 
were not dealing with a few score thousands of aristocrats or big 
landowners, but with millions of small men.” 

“Ten millions,” he said, holding up his hands, “It was fearful. 
Four years it lasted. It was absolutely necessary for Russia, if we 
were to avoid periodic famines, to plough the land with tractors. 
We must mechanise our agriculture. When we gave tractors to our 
peasants, they were all spoiled in a few months. Only Collective 
Farms with workshops could handle tractors. We took the greatest 
trouble to explain it to the peasants. It was no use arguing with 
them. After you have said all you can to a peasant he says he must 
go home and consult his wife, and he must consult his herder.” This 
last was a new expression to me in this connection. 

“After he has talked it over with them he always answers that 
he does not want the Collective Farm and he would rather do with- 
out the tractors.” 

“These were what you call Kulaks?” 

“Yes,” he said, but did not repeat the word. After a pause, “it 
was all very bad and difficult — but necessary.” 

“What happened?” I asked. 

“Oh, well,” he said, “many of them agreed to come in with us. 
Some of them were given land of their own to cultivate in the pro- 
vince of Tomsk or the province of Irkutsk or father north, but the 
great bulk were very unpopular and were wiped out by their 
labourers.” 

There was a considerable pause. Then, “Not only have we 
vastly increased the food supply, but we have improved the quality 
of the grain beyond all measure. All kinds of grain used to be 
grown. Now no one is allowed to sow any but the standard Soviet 



30 


My Days with Nehru 

gram from one end of our country to the other. If they do, they are 
severely dealt with. This means another large increase in ’the food 
supply.” 

1 record as they come back to me these memories, and the strong 
impression I sustained at the moment of millions of men and women 
being blotted out or displaced for ever. A generation would no 
doubt come to whom their miseries were unknonwn, but it would be 
sure of having more to eat and bless Stalin’s name. I did not repeat 
Burke s dictum ‘if we cannot have reform without injustice, I will 
not have reform.” With the World War going on all round us it 
seemed vain to moralise aloud. 

Later Stalin was to tell Winston Churchill that the death of single 
individual evoked great sorrow and immeasurable pathos; but the 
death of a million was a matters of statistics. This is more or less the 
maxim which guided Sidney Webb in his writings on Soviet Union. 
He explained away the liquidations by reducing them to percentages 
of the total population. 

The slavish practice of some “progressive” politicians in India 
calling people possessing a few acres of land “Kulaks” cannot be too 
strongly deprecated. Will the “progressives,” if there are any in the 
Indira Congress, brand Indira as a Kulak because she has five acres of 
agricultural land? 

Russia had been prone to famines throughout its history. For 
example in the Great Famine of 1601-03 millions of people perished. 
There, was the spectacle, during this period, of people in Moscow and 
elsewhere eating grass during summer and hay in the winter, and 
parents killing and cooking many of their children. In 1610 Russia was 
plagued by famine and disease and, coupled with external threats, the 
country was on the point of national disintegration. 

There is no doubt that considerable progress has been achieved in 
the Soviet Union in food production, but not to the extent of comfor- 
table self-suflSciency in spite of Khrushchev’s flamboyant programme 
of “Conquest of Virgin Lands.” Even now the Soviet Union is obliged 
to oeriodically import from the United States and Canada millions of 
tons of foodgrains. It is perhaps inevitable because vast regions of the 
country are unsuitable for farming and still substantial regions have 
only brief spells free from severe winter conditions. From this point of 
view India is placed in an advantageous position. 

On 22 March 1973 Dr S. Pavlov, leader of a group of six Soviet 
scientists, historians and transport experts, on completion of a 
fortnight’s tour of India, told newsmen in New Delhi that against a 


A Visit to the Soviet Union 


31 


per capita consumption, of 200 to 250 kilograms of grain per year, 
the Soviet Union was producing about 700 kilograms per capita per 
year. He added that whatever grain the Soviet Union imported 
from other countries was to carry out its commitment to “Socialist 
■countries.” 

Obviously the “Socialist countries” in this particular context do 
not include China, Albania and Yugoslavia. That means only the small 
•countries of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, German Democratic 
Republic and Poland are involved. According to Dr Pavlov’s state- 
ment, the Soviet Union produces three times the foodgrains needed 
for its own population — which means it can spare for the “Socialist 
countries” two-thirds of its foodgrain production. Considering the 
total population of all these small “Socialist countries,” one is entitled 
to ask “why imports at all?” Dr Pavlov has under-estimated the intel- 
ligence of his Indian readers. 

Alfred Gonsalves took a daughter of KPS, the elder sister of the 
'Wife of KPS (Mrs Candeth), and me to Leningrad. We saw the 
usual sights including a visit to the Hermitage, originally the winter 
Palace of the Tsars but now a magnificent art gallery. In the morning 
•of our return to Moscow from Leningrad I discovered that we had 
over an hour to spare. The two ladies and Alfred agreed to my sug- 
gestion to visit the small Pushkin museum in the city (where Pushkin 
lived), before leaving for the airport. We called a taxi whose driver 
told us that he knew only the large Pushkin museum some considerable 
•distance away and not the small one. At our suggestion he asked 
another taxi driver the way. That individual came to us and said that 
he knew the way I ut that he would not tell the other driver. So we 
Lad to take his taxi to visit the musuem and later to proceed to the 
airport. I told Alfred that the tongawala in Old Delhi would not 
behave in the way the Russian driver did, and that he would have 
gladly helped another tongawala. I asked Alfred the reason for the 
strange behaviour of a driver who belonged to a nationalized taxi 
services. Alfred said: “The answer is simple; if a taxi driver does more 
than a certain minimum mileage a month, he gets a bonus. So it is the 
•acquisitive instinct in man.” “From each according to his capacity to 
•each according to his need” remains a slogan in the Soviet Union. 

Apart from a law court and a school, I was taken to the Public 
Library by Alfred. I had heard that after the Library of Congress 
in Washington, the Moscow Public Library was the largest in the 
world. I wondered about and reached the Indian section. I asked for 
poet Kumaran Asaan’s Karima in Malayalam. Within a matter of 
.minutes the girl at the counter produced the book with a pleasant 



32 


My Days wiih Nehru 

smile. She told me: “J have also got the complete works of this great 
poet who died young, how sadl” I told her that Kumaran Assan and 
Vallathol were m} favourite poets in Malayaiam. Thereupon she 
promptly brought down a few books by Vallathol. Before leaving I 
thanked her and told her that I hoped that some day she would be 
included in one of the Soviet cultural delegations to India so that, apart 
from other things, she could have an opportunity of visiting the land 
of the two great poets we briefly discussed. She was an unusual girl 
to work at a library counter. 

I visited the Museum of Religion in Moscow about which I had 
heard a great deal before. I came away with the impression that as an 
instrument of propaganda it is a waste of effort. 

Certain parts of Moscow, out of the beaten track I managed to 
visit, were as shabby as the shabbiest part of Old Delhi. Housing shor- 
tage was more than acute in Moscow. Congestion was near to suffo- 
cation. But the hopeful aspect was that housing construction was 
going on at tremendous pace and on a large scale. But, unlike in 
Delhi and other metropolitan cities of India, rents were not only not 
murderous but well within the paying capacity of the people. In fact 
housing is subsidized and the benefit goes to all. Cooking gas was 
almost free. 

Bread was cheap; but prices of shoes and overcoats were inordina- 
tely high. Indian-made shoes are sold in Moscowat more than ten times 
what it cost the Soviet government to buy from the Indian market. I 
saw more than one person in Moscow walking about with a contrap- 
tion made of hay on their feet. I could not help seeing a few beggars 
in Moscow and its outskirts. The craze for foreign stuff among the 
people was as strong and wide-spread as in India. I mention these not 
to belittle the achievements of the Soviet Union but to indicate the 
necessity of having a balanced mind. 

Black caviar (I dislike pink caviar as much as pink champagne) was 
prohibitively costly in Moscow. It is a foreign exchange earner for the 
Soviet Union and a much sought-after delicacy by the westerners. The 
meagre supply of Russian black caviar, required by the Indian 
embassy for its entertainment, is bought from a duty-free firm in 
Denmark where the stuff is not costly. So is the case of scotch whisky 
required by foreign diplomatic mission in London. Because of heavy 
excise duty, scotch whisky is infinitely cheaper with the duty-free 
firm in Copenhagan than in London. 

My visit to Moscow in 1959 coincided with the retirement, later in 
the year, of the incomparable premier Ballerina Ulanova, the world s 
greatest living exponent of the art. I was fortunate to see her on the 



A Visit to the Soviet Union 


33 


stage of Bolshoi Theatre in one of her last performances — in the 
ballet “Gazelle.” Whenever Ulanova was dancing, her ex-husband 
would invariably be sitting wide-mouthed in one of the front rows. 

I did not fail to visit Lenin’s Mausoleum in the Red Square stret- 
ching the length of the Kremlin’s massive east wall. There lay the 
bodies of Lenin and Stalin side by side — their faces remarkably serene 
with no trace of the turbulence they engineered and lived through. 
Determination was writ large on the face of Stalin who led his people 
to victory in the Second World War. I think it was a 5 'ear after my 
visit to the Soviet Union that Stalin’s body was removed from the 
Mausoleum by Khrushchev unceremoniously and buried in some 
corner of the Kremlin grounds. Opinions can vary on this act of 
Khrushchev. Ever since man has existed as a self-conscious social 
creature 30,000 years ago or less, he yearned to be remembered after 
his life-time. In the middle of the present century an old semiliterate 
Englishman, living in London, walked about the streets always with 
his pockets bulging out with a copy of Plato’s Republic and a copy of 
Shakespeare’s Four Great Tragedies. When a friend asked him why he 
was carrying these books, which he had never read, he replied “the 
chances are that I will die as a result of a bus knocking me down. Then 
there will be an item in the obituary column of the Times mentioning 
my scholarly interests.” 

Incidently, the name “Red Square” has nothing to do with the 
Bolshevik Revolution. The great square bore that name from the time 
the “Third Rome” was built. “Red” in the Russian language also 
means “beautiful” and it was from that meaning that Moscow’s main 
square derived its name. The theologians of the Russian orthodox 
church produced the doctrine of the “Third Rome.” It held the first 
Rome had fallen into heresy, and, as punishment, had been overthrown 
by barbarians. The second Rome, Byzantium, had also become here- 
tical in acknowledging the supermacy of the Pope at the Council of 
Florence in 1438 — and consequently had been overrun by the Turks. 
However, although “two Romes have fallen, a third stands, and a 
fourth there shall not be.” The “Third Rome” was Moscow, the 
capital of the last truly Christian nation on earth, and the residence 
of a Tsar who in his power was “similar to God in Heaven.” 

Flanked by the towers of the Kremlin with its onion-shaped domes, 
the great square was an impressive open space and, after Ivan the Ter- 
rible built the magnificient St Basil’s Cathedral in the 16th century to 
commemorate his victories over the Tartars, it became more beautiful 
still. Its long, broad promenade, which separated the political and 



34 ' 


My Days with Nehru 

mercantile centres of the city, served Moscow much as the forum 
served ancient Rome. 

Khrushchev has done one thing which marks him out as a man not 
endowed with a sense of history. The changing of the name of Stalin- 
grad into something nobody can remember was a barbaric act of 
vandalism. No other name in the Second World War, or perhaps in 
history, has epitomised so completely human valour, endurance, deter- 
mination, faith and triumph. I do hope that one day the Soviet people 
. will compel their government to reinvest the city with its illustrious 
name to adorn for evbr the pages of the history of a heroic people. The 
Soviet Union is not unused to re-writing history. Even the British have 
done it. The Oxford History of India by Vincet A. Smith, which was 
standard textbook prescribed for college students in India, has descri- 
bed the Taj Mahal as “a barbaric ostentation completely devoid of 
artistic merit.” I find that the third edition of the book by the arrogant 
and ignorant ICS oflScial (issued in 1958) has been drastically revised 
and re-written by sensible men such as Dr A.L. Basham, Dr J.B. 
Harrison, Sir Mortimer Wheeler and Dr Percival Spear. In the revised 
edition references to Taj Mahal are “inimitable Taj,” “unrivalled 
monument” and “the unique beauty of the architectural master- 
piece.” 

It is well known that the Soviet Union has consistently supported 
the freedom movements among subject peoples. But the Soviet Union’s 
intervention in the Spanish Civil War in support of the Republican 
cause was not all that nishkama Karmatn as it was made out to be. 
General Alexander Orlov of the Soviet Intelligence Service (NKVD) 
arrived in Madrid on 16 September 1936, about two months before 
the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, to head a large Soviet mission 
of intelligence and military experts. For two years he was the Chief 
Soviet Adviser to the Republican government on intelligence, counter- 
intelligence and guerilla warfare. Before Madrid fell, the Republican 
government had kept in an ammunition dump cave about 725 tons of 
gold— the treasure of an ancient nation accumulated through the 
centuries. 

The Republican government was uncomfortable about keeping the 
treasure in a cave and of its falling into Franco’s laps. About that time 
Orlov received a direct code cable from Stalin signed in his code name 
“Ivan Vasilyevich” making him responsible for managing to get the 
gold out of Spain and transporting it to Moscow. Orlov easily managed 
to convince the Spanish Republican Prime Minister, Foreign Minister 
and Finance Minister about the advisability of transferring the gold 
reserves to the Soviet Union for “safekeeping.” Orlov despatched the 



A Visit to the Soviet Union 


35 


gold by ship to Odessa. When the treasure reached Moscow, Stalin 
threw a lavish party for the top NKVD brass. At the party Stalin said 
“they will never see their gold again just as they do not see their own 
ears.” The transaction represents the biggest single act of plunder in 
history. 

Franco learnt about the missing gold as soon as he took Madridi 
but not a word was said about it by his government for almost 18 years. 
The Spanish currency, already weak, would have surely collapsed if it 
had become known that the national coffers were nearly empty. The 
Spanish official silence was broken in December 1956, soon after the 
death of Negrin who was the Spanish Republican Prime Minister just 
before Franco’s victory. In his papers a receipt from the Soviet govern- 
ment was discovered. A few months later a typically ironic article in 
the official paper Pravda (which in the Russian language means 
“Truth”!) admitted that some 500 tons of gold had indeed been 
received in 1936 and a receipt issued by the Soviet government. The 
gold, it went on, was to guarantee payment for Soviet planes, arms 
and other goods delivered to the Spanish Republic. Not only had all 
been spent, but a balance of 50 million was owed to Soviet Russial 

After a stay of three weeks in the Soviet Union, I left for Geneva 
and London via Prague. I travelled in a Russian aeroHot jet. Leaving 
Moscow at 10.30 a.m. I arrived in Prague at 10 a.m. This reminded 
me of a story relating to the time difference between the Philippines 
and the United States — which is almost 24 hours. The Counsellor of 
the American Embassy in Manila sent a cable to the State Department 
in Washington stating “deeply regret to report that His Excellency the 
Ambassador died tomorrow.” 

I returned to Moscow from London via Geneva and Prague where 
I spent a couple of days. Prague appealed to me as a gracious city 
where I did not witness any outward signs of the rigours of a commu- 
nist regime even though the city was lacking in gaiety. I spent another 
three weeks in the Soviet Union before finally returning to India. 

Alfred Gonsalves was a delightful companion. He struck me as a 
young man of considerable promise in the Foreign Service. He was 
one of the very few young men in the Foreign Service, I have come 
across, who did not have any grouse about his salary, allowances and 
perquisites. He was interested in more serious and substantial matters. 
I imderstand he is now the Indian Ambassador in Tanzania. 

Before returning to India from the Soviet Union the impression I 
gathered was that the major cause of the phenomenal advance of the 
Soviet Union was the immense natural resources of that vast country 
and not communism. I asked myself, in the unlikely event of the small 



36 


My Days with Nehru 

enterprising country Denmark coming under communist regime, what 
would be the result. It would only result in sharp deterioration of the 
high standard of life in that country. What will be the result if commu- 
nism takes over in a small country like Ceylon with little known 
natural resources? I doubt if the production of coconut or rubber or 
tea or tobbacco will register any substantial increase. Communism, 
since the days of Marx, has become largely out of date. India’s future 
depends on its vast natural resources, its scientists, engineers, technical 
manpower and reasonably stable and competent governments dedica- 
ted to the welfare of the people — and not on communism which, in 
certain circumstances, can be a reactionary force. 

Another strong impression I gathered in the Soviet Union in 1959 
was that the process of relaxation would continue. The spirit of man 
cannot remain suppressed for long. Rigours and rigidities would slowly 
disappear and this great country, now a territorially contented nation, 
if left alone, would gradually give up the idea of exporting revolutions, 
and settle down ultimately, as France did after the Revolution, as a 
said country, with liberal institutions established but without giving 
up certain basic gains of the “Great October Revolution.” 

I have always held the view that among the events of real revolu- 
tionary significance in the history of mankind, the French Revolu- 
tion and the Russian Revolution are not of major importance. On the 
fertile delta of the Tigris and Euphrates, some time in the fourth 
millennium B.C., an unknown Sumerian produced what must surely be 
man’s greatest single technological achievement. Tie made the wheel 
— the greatest of all revolutions. 

More than any Indian Ambassador, KPS had the longest tenure at 
one post abroad — Moscow. He and his wife are endowed with the rare 
capacity to make friends and to retain friendship. During the tenure 
of KPS Indo-Soviet relations steadily developed, and economic and 
commercial ties, which were practically non-existent before, grew to 
a remarkable extent. KPS possessed the one quality which was needed 
most in Moscow— flexibility of mind. His wife, Amma, who has deep 
roots in the right type of Indian traditions, but with a modern mind, 
was a great asset to him. There was, however, a complaint against KPS 

tjjat he was a little too much identified with everything Russian, In 

fact some people look upon KPS and his wife as a pair of brown 
Russians, more especially because of their unfailing annual pilgri- 
mages to the Soviet Union. 

From Moscow I travelled to Delhi in the Russian aeroflot jet. For 
breakfast! was served beefsteak. I have no religious or other objec-

tions of eating almost anything; but I cannot bear the thought of eating 
beef for breakfast. I had no choice. The attitude of the flight crew was 
“take it or leave it.” So I left it, and went without breakfast. For the 
rest of the journey I felt proud of Air India and blessed J.R.D. Tata 
for once. 



5 A Political Impropriety Set Right 


Some time in August 1958 Mrs Tara Cherian, Mayor of Madras, 
came to see me with a problem confronting her husband, Dr P.V. 
Cherian, the noted ear-nose and throat surgeon, who was elected as 
Chairman of Madras Legislative Council in 1952. He was re-elected 
as a member of the Council in 1958 for another period of six years. 
Propriety demanded that, as he was re-elected to the council as a 
member, he should be re-elected as its chairman. But Chief Minister 
Kamaraj, who lacked finesse throughout his life, entertained other 
ideas. He wanted a man called Allapicbai as the chairman and made 
no secret of his intentions. Kamaraj should have thought about this 
matter earlier and told Dr Cherian of his intentions so that Dr 
Cherian could have, on his own volition, bowed out and ceased to be 
a member of the Council, Having made him a member again, it would 
have been an insult to the office Dr Cherian held if he were not re- 
elected as the Chairman. Mrs Cherian was natmally exercised over 
the matter. I assured her that at the appropriate time the Prime 
Minister and the Congress President would give earnest consideration 
to the matter. 

The Prime Minister spoke to Congress President U.N, Dhebar on 
the subject. The Congress President pointed out the impropriety to 
Chief Minister Kamaraj who gave the impression that he agreed. I 
informed Mrs Cherian about the developments. But Kamaraj proved 
unpredictable and till almost two days before the party meeting on 
9 September 1958, stuck to his man Allapichai. 

On 5 September 1958 Mrs Tara Cherian wrote to me a frantic 
letter reading as follows: 

MAYOR OF MADRAS 

Mrs. P.V. Cherian RIPON BUILDINGS MADRAS 

(Personal and Confidential) (Res) 5 Victoria Crescent, 

Madras-8, 5-9-1958. 


Dear Mr. Mathai, 

I thank you very much for your letter. I thought everything 
was going on alright till I heard this morning, when I went to meet 



A Political Impropriety Set Right 


39 


the delegates of the 10th International Agriculture Economists 
Conference, who arrived from Mysore, that there is going to be a 
different trend. Mr Bhaktavatsalam, Home Minister, was with me 
to receive the delegates and he told me that two days ago he had a 
talk with the Chief Minister here, and, in the course of the conver- 
sation, the Chief Minister made it very clear to him [Mr. Bakta- 
vatsalam] that he was for Allapichai. They have fixed the Congress 
Legislature Party meeting on 9 September and the executive to 
meet earlier to decide about the chairmanship. My husband also 
seemed to have talked with the Finance Minister, and although 
his inclination is towards my husband, yet he made it clear that 
the Chief Minister is fully backing the other man. Sorry to give 
you all this worry, but if anything is to happen at this juncture 
(only a few more days are left), it should be done immediately as 
he has fixed the party meeting to the last hour, and if any decision 
were taken it will become irrevocrable. May I therefore request 
you kindly to put in your last effort to see that Panditji sends his 
directive to the Chief Minister here (Dhebarbahai is not in Delhi). 
I leave it completely to you to do. whatever you feel is the best, 
and I know you will do it. As the last resort I feel that instructions 
should be sent to the Chief Minister to do the right thing, other- 
wise it will be too late. 

I hope you don’t mind my troubling you. With our kind regards. 

Yours sincerely,

On the same day Dr Cherian also wrote to me on the subject. 
This letter is quoted on the next page. 

On 7 September 1958, U.S. Malliah, MP. a friend of Kamaraj, 
telephoned to the latter at my instance. Malliah told Kamaraj in no 
uncertain terms that the Prime Minister would not like him to 
commit the impropriety in the case of Dr Cherian. That settled the 
matter. 

A very prominent Congress MLA from Madras wrote a letter to 
the Prime Minister on 10 September 1958, the day after the party

dear Hr. Matthal, 

Hy wife has already written to you. Fron what 1 gather 
^ they have created a very distressing situation for ne. I had 
a talk with Mr. C . Subramanlam and R-Ve-nJcataranan today. 
C.Subraaaniara was definite that the C.K. is working in" the 
-dnectlon of Allapiohai. Venlcataraman also spoke on the sane 
lines. "The meeting of the Congress Party to decide on the 
candidate will take place at 6 P.K. on the 9th. At 5-30 P.H. 
they have an Executive Committee meeting. 'I an sure the C.il. 
will Insist on Allapichal's nomination. 

(/e were most happy and Jubilant when vc received your 
latter a few days ago saying that KamraJ had agreed to my 
nomination. I do not know what has happened after that. I do 
hope something will bo done from Delhi to effectively see that 
I an nominated. 

l/o are sorry to give you this trouble, but you will 
appreciate how difficult the* situation has become. We shall 
be grateful for all your help. Thanking you and with best regards,

meeting at which Dr Cherian’s name was approved. I quote the 
letter on p. 40. 

I will be failing in my duty as a Congressman if I do not bring 
to your notice the reacitons and the depth of feeling in the party, 
to the nomination of Dr P.V. Cherian as the Congress party’s 
nominee, for the Chairmanship of the Legislative Council. 

Our Leader Shri K. Kamaraj explained at the party meeting 
yesterday that it is the desire of both you and the Congress 
President that a convention might be established that the Chair- 
men of the Legislative Councils and Speakers of Assemblies may be 
continued in the same office if they should be re-elected to these 
bodies. While we concede that a convention of this sort may be

good and desirable if strong Partymen are elected to these posts, 
thrusting an unwanted candidate with a veiled directive is a 
serious blow to democratic principles and traditions. Df Cherian, 
in thd first instance, is not a Congressman in the accepted sense of 
the term. He was brought in as Chairman in the year 1952 by 
Rajaji more as an expedient and to get the support of Independents 
like Dr A. Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar and others in opposition. 

During the British period Dr Cherian and his wife Mrs Cherian 
were their ardent supporters and admirers. As Pjincipal of the 
Medical College in the year 1942 he expelled a number of students 
who participated in the 1942 movement. During those days any 
one clad in Khadar was a provocation to him. He is devoid of any 
national feelings. He is essentially an opportunist making the best 
of the Government in power. 

His accidental election in 1952 under the peculiar circumstances 
then existing has now placed him in an advantage over all Congress- 
men. The veiled direction of the High Command asking the Party 
to re-elect him has put all the members of the Party in an embar- 
rassing position. I may tell you, sir, that at the Party meeting 
yesterday, not a single member was for Dr Cherian. It was unani- 
mous wish that he should go. The Chief Minister explained that 
we must respect the wishes of the Prime Minister in this matter, 
in spite of what we may personally feel about it. All that I can 
say is what has happened is not good for our Party or for the 
State. Several Congressmen who toil night and day. for the Party 
are beginning to wonder whether it is not all in vain. 

Few politicians speak the whole truth; and Kamaraj was no excep- 
tion. Kamaraj failed to inform the party of the mistakes he had com- 
mitted and gave the wrong impression that the Prime Minister was 
thrusting Dr Cherian on the party. Kamaraj could have avoided 
problems for himself and others if he had dealt with Dr Cherian as 
the P.M. dealt with Ananthasayanam Ayangar, Speaker of the Lok 
Sabha, who was privately advised in advance not to seek re-election 
to the Lok Sabha. In fact it was Ananthasayanam Ayyangar himself 
who formally announced his intention not to seek re-election to the 
Lok Sabha. Later he was sent as the Governor of Bihar. 

On 11 September 1958, Mrs Cherian wrote to me. I quote the 
letter on next page.

On the same day Dr P.V. Cherian also wrote to me. The letter is 
quoted on the next page. 

I am glad Dr and Mrs Cherian prospered thereafter. At the ins- 
tance of President Radhakrishnan, Dr Cherian was appointed Govenor 
of Maharashtra towards the latter part of 1964 in succession to 
Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit who gave up the governorship as she did not 
like to continue as “the organ grinder’s monkey.” She joined active 
politics again. 

The Cherian episode in Madras earned me the permanent displea- 
sure of Kamaraj. But it did not bother me.

6 Nehru’s Mail 


The biggest price a celebrity has to pay is to receive a terrific amount 
of mail daily. 

Next to Americans, Indians are the greatest letter writters. Indians 
are next to none in writing anonymous letters. 

I had issued standing instructions to the mail staff to put in the 
waste paper basket all anonymous letters except any about me which 
was rare. I did not think it was proper for me to suppress anonymous 
letters about me. I invariably put them up before the Prime Minister. 

I have recollection of having suppressed only one letter. It was from 
C. Rajagopalachari. Rajaji, after relinquishing all offices, had turned 
bitter, formed the Swatantra Party, and started criticizing and 
advising the Prime Minister publicly. On the resignation of T.T. 
Krishnamachari from the Cabinet following the storm over the 
“Mundhra affair,” Rajaji wrote from Madras gloating over the exit 
of one of his early antipathies, and recommending K. Santhnnam as 
the new Finance Minister. I thought Rajaji had forfeited his claim to 
offer private advice unsolicited. In any event the letter would have 
only irritated the Prime Minister; and there was not ghost of a chance 
of Santhanam being considered. About ten days later I did mention 
the matter to the Prime Minister who laughed it off. 

I had also issued standing instructions to the mail staff to collect 
stamps from all letters, Indian and foreign, and keep them country- 
wise. 

A substantial part of the foreign mail came from the United States. 
Numerous children wrote- and asked Nehru for autographs, auto- 
graped photographs as well as stamps. Nehru was particular about 
obliging them. Occasionally an interesting or amusing letter from a 
child was put up to the Prime Minister who loved to send a personal 
reply. 

Iimumerable Indian children also wrote and ■ asked the Prime 
Minister for autographs, autographed photographs and postage stamps. 
Some of them sent leaves from their autograph books and some sent 
whole books. Nehru was generous with his time for these children; , 
and all their requests were attended to. Many Indian and American 
children sent their pocket-money to Nehru when they heard of floods

and other natural calamities in India. 

One day a letter from Lebanon addressed to “Bandit Nehru” was 
received through post at the Prime Minister’s Secretariat in 1949. 
It read:

In the early years in office Nehru received a vast number of letters 
on two subjects: 

(1) Black-marketers. Soon after his release from prison in 1945 
Nehru referred feelingly to the death of millions during the Bengal 



46 


My Days with Nehru 

famine and said that black-marketers and others who make profit on 
the misery of people should be hanged from the nearest lamp post 
Several letters asked for the names and addresses of those hanged on 
lamp-posts. The only answer which could be sent was; 

(u) information is being collected. 

(Jb) addresses are c/o Hell 
In fact no replies were sent. 

(2) Banning of Harmonium. Some time in the thirties Nehru, in one 
of his public speeches, had said that in independent India the harmo- 
nium should be banned. Thousands of letter-writers wanted to know 
why it had not been done for two years after he became the Prime 
Minister. 

Nehru was informed of the receipt of such letters and that no indi- 
vidual replies were sent. It was thought that in one of his public 
speeches he might refer to them. Nehru chose to ignore them. Black- 
marketers and the harmonium have survived and will continue to 
survive'. 

On controversial issues coming up for decisions or legislation, the 
Prime Minister’s offices at the Secretariat and the Prime Minister’s 
house would be flooded with telegrams and letters from the common 
people. They were not put up to Nehru; but they were classified and 
a short note was placed before the Prime Minister indicating the total 
number of telegrams and letters received, the number ‘Tor” and the 
number “against.” Nehru was interested in this information and some- 
times he would even predict what the percentage would be “for” and 
what it would be “against.” 

This reminded me later of an episode in President Truman’s life. 
On the evening of 5 December 1950, President Truman’s young 
daughter Margaret gave the final concert of her 1950 tour at Consti- 
tution Hall in Washington. Earlier in the day the President’s boyhood 
friend, who had become bis Press Secretary, died. Apart from that, 
the President was harrassed by reports of developments in Korea. The 
next day at 5 a.m. the President arose to grapple with the Korea pro- 
blem. He picked up the Washington Post and read a savage review of 
Margaret’s performance by the paper’s music critic Paul Hume. “She 
is fiat a good deal of the time,” he wrote, “she cannot sing witli'any- 

thing approaching professional finish She communicates almost 

nothing of the music she presents.” The President was aware of that 
during the intermission of Margaret’s concert the previous evening. 
The music critic for the Times-Herald had gone back-stage and 
congratulated Margaret. In Paul Hume’s review Truman saw red in 
what seemed to be more malice than judgment. He sat down and 



Nehru’s Mail 


47 


wrpte Paul Hume a very angry letter in long hand. He told Hume that 
he sounded like “a frustrated man that never made a success, an eight- 
ulcer man on a four-ulcer job and all four ulcers working.” Hume pub- 
lished the letter and the uproar was vast. Truman never felt the sligh- 
test remorse about sending the letter. He always insisted he had the 
right to be two persons — the President of the United States; and Harry 
S. Truman, father of Margaret and husband of Bess. “It was Harry S. 
Truman, the human being, who wrote that note,” he said. 

Truman was annoyed to find that all his aides thought that sending 
of that letter of Paul Hume was a mistake. They felt that it damaged 
his image as President and would only add to his political diflSculties. 
“Wait till the mail comes in,” Truman said, “I will make you a bet 
that 80 per cent of it will be on my side of the argument.” A week 
later, after the staff meeing, the President ordered every one to follow 
him, and they marched to the mml room. The clerks had stacked the 
thousands of “Hume” letters in piles and made up a chart showing 
the percentages for and against the President. Slightly over 80 per 
cent favoured the President’s defence of his daughter. Most of the 
letter-writers were mothers who said they understood exactly how the 
President felt and would have expected their husbands to .defend their 
daughters the same way. “The trouble with you guys is,” the President 
said to the staff as he strode back to work, “you don’t understand 
human nature.” 

In the meantime one of Truman’s aides succeeded in persuading 
Paul Hume to return the letter to the white House. Paul Hume felt 
foolish soon after because he received from an avid American “Collec- 
tor” an ofier of $ 150,000 for the original letter. 

When the Union Finance Minister stopped all imports of foreign 
cosmetics because of foreign exchange shortage, the sophisticated 
women of India were up in arms. In New Delhi, groups of hysterical 
women came to the Prime Minister’s house in the mornings looking 
fierce. Indira’s sympathies were understandably with them. She told 
me that it was not the question of craze for foreign stuff; nothing 
worthwhile was manufactured in India then; “Shrmgar” (beautifica- 
« tion) had been important for Indian women from time immemorial. I 
asked her what was the percentage of Indian women who beautified 
themselves with foreign stuff? This question annoyed her. She puni- 
shed me for it by not speaking to me for a week. A group of women 
waylaid the Prime Minister in front of the Ministry of External 
Affairs. Some were wailing. As he strode to the office he asked me: 
“Why can’t somebody manufacture the stuff in India?.” 

The Prime Minister’s offices at the Secretariat and the house were 



48 


My Bays niz/i Nehru 

flooded with telegrams and letters from women all over India. Many 
abused the Finance Minister for persecuting and torturing women. 
Some described him as wrose than Manu. Indeed the Finance Minister 
had disturbed a veritable hornet’s nest. I watched, with amusement, 
from a safe distance, the demonstration of women’s power. 

I sent for K.A.D. Naoroji, the local Director of Tatas in New 
Delhi. Kish, as he was called, hailed from a distinguished family and 
was a delightful man with a robust sense of humour. He was the 
grandson of Dadabhoi Naroroji, one of the early Presidents of the 
Indian National Congress. Kish, the dear and most likeable man, came 
to see me. I told him that it was perhaps ironic that he and I, two 
bachelors, were going to discuss women’s problems. I asked him: 
“Can’t the Tatas go into the cosmetic business in a big way and manu- 
facture in India the whole range of the stuff— everything that women 
needed?” I said that the Tatas could expect all the assistance from 
the government for this project. He said that this could be done and 
that his Chairman, J.R;D. Tata, was likely to take personal interest in 
it. He sent a telex message to J.R.D. Tata in Bombay. The next day 
Kish rang up to say that the Tatas would undertake the project on a 
priority basis; but he wanted my assistance in removing bureaucratic 
delays. I reported to the Prime Minister. He was pleased and asked 
me to write to the Commerce and Industry Ministry on his behalf. 
Accordingly I wrote to the Secretary of the Ministry and sent a copy 
to Kish authorizing him to show it to anyone who delayed matters. I 
also spoke to the Minister of Commerce and Industry and the Finance 
Minister and told Kish about it. I had told him that be might report 
to me whenever there was any bottleneck. He never had to report, for 
there was no bottleneck in this case. This was the beginning of 
LAKME, a new company in the Tata group initially with French 
collaboration. If George Fernandes wants to break up large industrial 
groups under business families, he will do well to consult Indian 
women about the future of LAKME because they are the ultimate 
owners of LAKME though not in the financial sense. 

While we were in London in 1 948, a member of the small staff from 
the Indian- High Commission attached to the Prime Minister reported 
to me that a middle-aged English woman had arrived at the hotel 
{Claridges) requesting a meeting with someone connected with Prime 
Minister Nehru. She was shown in. She introduced herself as 
Margaret Cholmondeley. She had come with a letter written to her by 
a man called Ramamritham (Rao Saheb), an Assistant Secretary in the 
Ministry of External Affairs. The letter was in reply to a communi- 
cation she had addressed to the Prime Minister on Kashmir. It was the 



Nehru's Mail 


49 


practice in the Prime Minister’s Secretariat to pass on such letters of 
a general nature to the External Affairs Ministry for appropriate 
replies. She had a serious complaint about that letter because she was 
addressed as “Mr. Margaret Cholmondeley.” She had a further com- 
plaint that the name “Ramamritham” was too much of a mouthful. I 
was somewhat annoyed and mumbled to myself “as if hers is not.” I 
told her that Ramamritham was an old man who had never travelled 
abroad; so he could not distinguish female names from male ones. I 
asked her if she could say whether “Lakshmikanthamma Reddy” was 
a male or female name. She said “No.” I told her that almost all 
Indian names had meanings and they sounded musical to Indians. I 
asked her: “If I call you Miss Chumley won’t you be agreeably sur- 
prised?” She said; “You are the first Indian why has pronounced my 
name correctly.” I told her that “we in Indian are used to phonetic 
languages. We pronounce according to the spelling. English is an 
illogical language though a sublime one and some of your names are 
bafiBing to foreigners. I happen to know personally a Lord Cholmon- 
deley in London who has a valet called Bottomley who created 
complications by changing the pronounciation to Burnley. But for 
this knowledge, I would not have been able to pronounce your name 
correctly.” Then I told her how an Indian name helped in the escape 
of three Indians from Germany after Hitler had seized power. Mr 
A.C.N. Nambiar was informed by his German friends that Hitler’s 
S.S. were after him and two other Indians and that they should hasten 
to escape to Switzerland. Nambiar took the advice, collected the two 
Indians and left Berlin, As they came within a few yards of the Swiss 
border, an S.S. Captain arrived from nowhere and stopped them. He 
lined them up; took out a note-book and started asking questions in 
English. First came a Bengali who was a voluble and argumentative 
individual.

The S.S. Captain was flabbergasted. He looked around and made 
sure that no S.S. man was spying on him. Then he said: “Go, I will 
never be able to write this.” All the three walked’bver to the safety of 
Switzerland. 

I also told her how an Indian name created temporary estrange- 
ment between a husband and wife. The story relates to Alladi 
Krishnaswami Aiyar, the renowned lawyer of Madras. On the day he 
was knighted by the British Government in India, the lawyer told his 
wife in Tamil, “Nee Lady Alladi.” This lent itself to two meanings. 
The lawyer meant “you are Lady Alladi.” The wife understood only 
the other meaning “you are no lady.” The immediate result can be 
imagined. 

I had to agree with Margaret Cholmondeley that in the Foreign 
OIBce people should know better about foreign countries, but that our 
names could not be changed. I also told her that the British had to 
unlearn many things and learn new things. I reminded her that it was 



Nehru's Mail 


51 


only recently that an Englishman returned from a visit to Egypt and 
made the revelation that the Meditarranean Sea was south of the 
African continent because he saw that the Nile was flowing into the 
Mediterranean at Alexandria. He could not conceive of any river flow- 
ing other than to the South because he was used to the Thames flow- 
ing South! I also told her that we in India did no longer use expres- 
sions like Middle East, Near East, and Far East. You invented those 
names while you thought that London was the centre of the world. It 
will no longer be the case. Before long London will become a city 
where international statesmen change planes. In India we now use 
terms like West Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia. Margaret 
Cholmondeley said: “There will always be an England.” I told her: 
“That is what the poet has said. There will always be a Peru also.” She 
asked me if she could come the next day for another talk. I made my 
excuses; and she left. I thought I had humoured her enough and 
more. 

An Italian countess from Milan wrote to Nehru periodically. She 
commended his policy of peace, nonalignment, and peaceful coexis- 
tence. In her letters she never gave her address. She started experi- 
ments with animals in peaceful coexistence. She achieved some result 
and sent to Nehru a photograph of herself, a dog, a cat, a rat, a 
mongoose and a snake — all playing together. 

Sometimes mail could create embarrassments and disappointments. 
Suhrawardy, the revolutionary who lived in England and Europe for 
long until after independence, had a bad experience in the late twen- 
ties soon after he arrived in Rome. An important Italian paper 
announced his arrival in the Eternal City with a write-up about him 
highlighting the episode of his arrest in Moscow and subsequent 
release. It is a fact that Suhrawardy was in Moscow living with a 
beautiful Russian countess, who was a widow. Of all the good things 
in the world, Suhrawardy loved women and Indian food the most. On 
the day of the attempt on Lenin’s life, Suhrawardy’s countess got 
indisposed. Suhrawardy, who knew the Russian language well, deci- 
ded to go to a drug store to buy some medicines despite the advice of 
the countess to the contrary. Roads were empty, all shops were closed, 
and police vehicles were plying all over picking up suspected anar- 
chists. He knew a drug-store and knocked at the door which was 
opened and he was admitted in. There he was advised about the 
danger of being found loitering on the main roads. He got the medi- 
cines and the kindly shop-keeper let him out into a lane through the 
back-door. Soon a police-van picked up Suhrawardy and dumped hiTn 
into a hall where anarchists were detained. That night the anarchists 



52 


My Days' with Nehru 


in the hall held a meeting. Half way through, a young 'woman anar- 
chist got up with a loaded revolver and made an impassioned speech. 
Pointing the revolver in all directions, she said: “Comrades, prepare 
yourselves to die tonight; it is by giving up our lives that anarchism 
will live.” People were terrified of the revolver in the hands of a 
hysterical woman. At last some one got up and said: “Let us hear what 
our Indian comrade has to say. There was a chorus of the demand. 
Suhrawardy, who knew nothing of anarchism, got up and made a little 
speech which he wound up by the peroration “Indian anarchists firmly 
believe that we must live so that anarchism will not die.” Everyone 
applauded in which the woman with the revolver was drowned. All 
rose and shouted “long live Indian anarchism.” The So^iet police 
soon found out that Suhrawardy had nothing to do with anarchism; 
and they released him. 

The publicity in the Italian paper brought good tidings to 
Suhrawardy. Through the mail came an invitation from an Italian 
countess living in a villa on the outskirts of Rome. And what was 
equally exciting, the countess had offered Indian food. Suhrawardy 
conjured up a beautiful young Italian countess resembling Lord 
Byron’s mistress Madame Gluccioli as well as Kababs and spiced meat 
preparations. 

At the appointed time Suhrawardy arrived at the villa where he was 
met by a footman in resplendent livery and taken to the countess who 
happened to be an old woman in her eighties. Suhrawardy's enthusiasm 
collapsed. They sat down sipping fruit juice. The countess, who knew 
English, started talking about the four Vedas and the Upanishads. He 
had to spend one whole uncomfortable hour discussing old scriptures 
about which he knew nothing. He somehow managed to answer some 
elementary questions. To his relief, dinner was announced. The coun- 
tess said: “Let us sit down on the floor in Indian style and take our 
food.” The food consisted of rice and milk and fresh fruits in season! 
Suhrawardy’s heart sank. After dinner there was more discussion on 
spiritual subjects. When he completed submitting himself to this tor- 
ture, the old countress suggested his spending the night in the villa as 
the last bus to Rome had left. Suhrawardy was so worked up that he 
wanted to shock the countess. He told her ‘,T know a prostitute in the 
nearby village, and I have promised to sleep with her tonight.” After 
shocking the countess, Suhrawardy walked all the way back to his 

hotel in Rome. ,

7 Dr Syud Hossain 


After Syud Hossain eioped with. Swarup Nehru (later Vijaya Lakshmi 
Pandit) and returned, he was advised by friends and foes to leave the 
country. He quietly left for the United States and lived there conti- 
nuously for over 25 years. There he belonged to a group of Indians 
who did what they could for the cause of India’s freedom. 

In 1945, while Vijaya Lakshmi’s husband was no longer alive, she 
left for the United States and spent a considerable time in that

country, returning to India in January 1946. This gave Syud Hossain 
the opportunity to renew his relationship with Vijaya Lakshmi who 
was then only, forty-five. During this period Gandhi received letters 
from several Indians in the United States complaining that Syud 
Hossain was following Vijaya Lakshmi every where like her shadow. 

Early in September 1945 Nehru received cable from Syud Hossain 
(see page 53): 

Nehru consulted Asaf Ali and others. He did not fail to consult 
Gandhi on the subject. The shrewd advice of Gandhi was designed to 
prevent the gossip mill from working overtime impairing Vijaya 
Lakshmi’s usefulness. Nehru sent the following reply to Syud Hossain:

I think it was in January 1947 that Syud Hossain came back, 
rhat was a time when the communal situation vras bad J" ^ - 
particularly in Delhi. Nehru was then staying at York Road^Syu 
Tossain established himself in Hotel Imperial. Vijaya Lakshmi did 
lot fail to come from Lucknow to spend as much time as possi 

n Delhi during this period.

Syud Hossain, a short, thin and fair man, would come to 17 York 
Road, every morning wearing rimless glasses and with a curved flat 
flask of cognac (brandy) tucked into his hip-pocket. Periodically he 
would take out the flask and have a gulp. Fancy drinking cognac in 
the morning! 

The presence of Syud Hossain at the Hotel Imperial and Vijaya 
Lakshmi spending much time with him there became known to re- 
fugees with revenge in their blood-shot eyes— both Hindus and Sikhs. 
This created problems for the much harrassed police. They, however, 
made discreet arrangements for the protection of Syud Hossain and 
Vijaya Lakshmi. 

The embarrasing situation was not prolonged as Syud Hossain was 
appointed as Ambassador to Egypt. 

After Syud Hossain got settled in Cairo, Vijaya Lakshmi told 
Secretary- Generel Girja Shankar Bajpai of her wish to break journey 
in Cairo on her way to New York to attend the UN General Assem- 
bly. Bajpai consulted the Prime Minister who said that she should go 
straight to New York. She, however managed to halt in Cairo. The 
PTI man there was prevailed upon to send out a message that the halt 
was due to engine trouble of the Air India plane. Later it was dis- 
covered that the “engine trouble” did not affect any other passenger. 

Syud Hossain did not last long in Cairo. Death put an end to an 
unhappy and tortured life. Government did not fail to build a suitable 
mausoleum for him in Cairo. 



8 Subhas Chandra Bose {1897-1945) 


Eight years younger than Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose was un- 
doubtedly a bright star in the Indian firmament in the first half of the 
present century. As dedicated as Nehru and as egoistic as V. K. Krishna 
Menon, Bose was a complicated person, a born fighter and a bom 
loser. As early as 1929 Bose held the view that Gandhi’s personality 
would triumph over Nehru’s personal views. 

Due to his burning zeal for national freedom and his single-minded- 
ness of purpose, Bose developed a one-track mind. To him the enemy 
of his enemy was automatically his friend. He did not subscribe to 
the view that the devil one kr.eww'as preferably to the devil one knew 
not. That explains his refusal to say anything against Nazi Germany, 
Fascist Italy and Japan which had an inglorious imperialist record. 
While Nehru refused to meet Mussolini, Bose was ready and eager to 
co-operate with him, Hitler and militarist Japan. In spite of his long 
stay in Europe as an exile and otherwise, Bose’s understanding of 
international affairs remained astonishingly poor, or perhaps he did 
not want to understand anything which was not in line with his pre- 
conceived notions. While his dedication to the country was total, Bose 
had on commitment to anything wider than nationalism— not even to 
socialism. 

Bose ridiculed Nehru of practising “sentimental politics.” Once he 
described Nehru as the supporter of all lost causes such as China and 
Spain. 

For his re-election as President of the Indian National Congress in 
1939 Bose went to the extent of inducing Rabindranath Tagore to 
lobby for him. Bose was never assailed by thoughts of “means and 
ends.” In fact he did not have such thoughts. Bose’s approach to 
Tagore was repugnant to Nehru. After his re-election in the teeth of 
Gandhi’s opposition, Bose felt that h.e was on the crest of a wave. He 
hastily proclaimed a confrontation between the “Right” and the 
“Left.” He grossly under-estimated the indispensablitiy and the in- 
herent strength of Gandhi in the situation that prevailed in India at 
that time. Bose’s judgment and sense of timing left much to be dwired. 
Thi^ ultimately led to Bose’s resignation from the Congress President- 
ship. He got himself isolated and ostracised, and formed a new party— 



Subhas Chandra Bose {1897-1945) 


57 


the Forward Bloc. Bose, who had earlier accused Nehru of lacking 
‘^‘revolutionary perspective” and stamina to establish an organization 
and form cadres, proved himself no better. Bose eventually reduced 
himself as a symbol of Bengal, and ultimately exiled himself from the 
country. 

About the circumstances which led to the resignation of Bose 
from the Presidentship of the Congress at Tripuri, Profsessor Hiren 
Mookerjee, in his book The Gentle Colossuse, has recorded that 
history might have been different and brighter if Nehru and Bose had, 
at this stage, together led left-wing forces. I do not khow if it would 
have been brighter; but certainly it would have been different — the 
national cause would have been weakened at a crucial stage and the 
British would have been the gainers in the process. 

When the Second World War was declared, Nehru happened to be 
in China A little before that Gandhi visited Madras. As I was in 
Madras then, I attended the public meeting at the Marina beach. The 
crowed was large. Soon after the declaration of the war, Bose came to 
Madras and addressed apublic meeting at the same place. It was known 
earlier that Bose would be attacking Gandhi and the Old Guard as well 
as Nehru. 1 attended the meeting which was much larger than the one 
addressed by Gandhi. Some time later Nehru also came. I attended 
his meeting too which was held at the same beach. The attendance at 
Nehru’s meeting was infinitely larger than the previous two meetings, 
Nehru had always been the most popular national leader in the south — 
more popular then Gandhi himself. 

Subhas Chandra Bose was free from communalismand obsciu-antism. 
He was a truly liberated person who possessed many of the qualities 
needed in a great leader of a vast country with its infinite variety, reli- 
gious and linguistic. Bose was an ardent admirer of that great son of 
India Swami Vivekananda. In a letter written early in 1932 to a journa- 
list friend Bose said of Swami Vivekananda thus: 

Swamiji was entirely free from the slightest trace of what you may 
call spiritual'cant. He could not stand even the sight of it. To the 
Pseudo-religious he would say “salvation will come through football 
and not through the Gita.” Though a Vedantin he was a great de- 
votee of the Lord Buddha. One day he was speaking so enthusiasti- 
cally of the Buddha that somebody said “Swamiji, are you a 
Budhist?” At once his emotions bubbled forth and in a choked voice 
he said “What? I a Buddhist! I am the servant of the Servants of the 
Buddha.! 

Similarly he was one day lecturing about Jesus Chirst when 



58 


My Days with Nehru 

somebody put a question. At once he grew grave and serious and in 
sonorous notes said; “If 1 had been present at the time of Jesus of 
Nazareth, I would have washed his feet not with my tears but with 
my heart’s blood!” 

Soon after Bose arrived in Berlin during the war, he enquired about 
the whereabouts of A.C.N. Nambiar whom he had known earlier in 
Europe as a revolutionary. Bose discovered that Nambiar escaped from 
Czechoslovkia when the Nazis occupied that country and stayed in Paris 
until about the surrender of France. Then he moved to an area under 
the control of “Vichy” France close to the Spanish border. At the re- 
quest of Bose the Nazi authorities sent an S.S. Captain to Nambiar 
with a letter from Bose requesting him to visit Berlin for a talk with 
him. Reluctantly Nambiar went. Bose narrated to him the circums- 
tances under which he escaped from India. He made it clear that his 
only aim was the freedom of India. He said that whatever happened, 
the British Empire in India was finished. If the allies won, then Nehru 
would be there in India, and he would make a good Prime Minister; if 
the axis powers won, he (Bose) would be there. Bose considered him- 
self and Nehru as two peas in the same pod. He asked Nambiar to work 
with him. Nambiar explained to Bose that he had a horror of the Nazi 
regime and all it stood for and expressed his unwillingess to stay in 
Germany, Bose ultimately persuaded a reluctant Nambiar to stay and 
help him. 

Several years after the end of World War II, Nambiar came across 
a man called Scarpa who was the Italian Consul-General in India in 
the thirties. He was a very active person and knew several national 
leaders, including Sarojini Naidu, personally. Padmaja, whose name 
is pronounced in northern India as Padam Jha!, also knew Scarpa very 
well. Before the outbreak of the war Scarpa was back in Italy. During 
the war he was an adviser in the Italian Foreign Ofiicc. Scarpa told 
Nambiar about the existence of a letter from Bose to the Italain 
Foreign Minister Count Ciano endorsing the Italian conquest of 
Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and its right to hold it. Nambiar showed scepti- 
cism as he did not think that Bose could have gone to that extent. The 
next time Scarpa met Nambiar in Geneva. The former had brought 
Bose’s letter in original and showed it to him. The letter must be still 
in the archives of the Italian' Foreign OflScc. 

During the spring of 1942 Nehru declared that the Congress would 
continue its policy of non-embarrassment to the British and that war 
production should not be impeded. On 8 April 1942, Nehru said in a 
Jn npiu;- “Srime neonle .sav Jawaharlal is a fool. He is unneces- 


Subhas Chandra Bose (1897-1945)

sarily antagonising the Japanese and the Germans. The Japanese will 
wreak vengeance on him when they come to this country. It is wiser 
for him to keep silent if he cannot actually speak well of the Japanese. 
I want to tell those who give me this advice that Jawaharlal is not the 
man who will keep quiet when he ought to speak. On the other hand, 
I can only reject such advice, which is essentially based on fear, with 
contempt.” 

At a press conference in Delhi on 12 April 1942, Nehru went to the 
extent of declaring that he would even oppose Subhas Chandra Bose 
and the Indian troops he had assembled from the prisoners of war with 
the Japanese because Nehru considered this army as on more than “a 
dummy force under Japanese control.” 

At this stage both Maulana Azad and Gandhi restrained Nehru. At 
the meetings of the Congress Working Committee that followed Nehru 
rejected two drafts of a resolution by Gandhi. Ultimately it was Nehru’s 
draft which was adopted. 

At a press conference on 12 April 1942, Nehru said “it is a hate- 
ful notion that after five years of war, China should be defeated; it is 
a hateful notion that Russia, which represents certain human values, 
which means a great deal to human civilization, should be defeated. 
But, ultimately, naturally I have to judge every question from the Indian 
view-point. If India perishes, I must say— selfishly if you like to call it 
— it does not do me any good if other nations survived/’ 

Early in June 1942 Nehru told the U.P. Congress Committee: “Per- 
sonally I am so sick of slavery that I am even prepared to take the risk 
of anarchy.” Nehru was moving nearer to Gandhi in the crisis which 
culminated in the Quite India movement of 1942. 

When the news of Subhas Chandra Bose’ death in an aircraft 
accident in 1945 reached him, Nehru paid tribute to his comrade in the 
freedom struggle with tears rolling down his cheeks. 

The twenty thousand and odd officers and men of Subhas Bose’s 
Indian National Army found themselves as prisoners of war again 
— this time under the British who held them guilty of treason in 
having broken their oath and gone over to the enemy. The Govern- 
ment of India decided to stage a public trial of three INA ofiicers — a 
senseless decision of an alien government which was about to disappear. 
To the British they were traitors, but to the people of India they were 
the opposite of traitors. The British soon discovered that the country 
was deeply stirred; that all the major political parties, including the 
Muslim League, were ranged on the side of the INA; and, what was 
worse, the lower ranks of serving soldiers were so touched as to pose 
a threat to the stability of the Indian Army. Nehru’s attitude towards 



60 


My Days with Nehru 


the INA was one of human sympathy. The most unsympathetic and 
uncompromisingly hostile body of men towards the INA comprised 
the senior Indian officers of the Indian army from Cariappa down- 
wards. This led Nehru to conclude that at no time was it possible to 
reinduct and reintegrate the officers and men of the INA in the 
regular Indian army. 

Nehru organized the defence of the INA personnel and raised funds 
for their relief and rehabilitation. Part of these funds was ear- marked 
for Bose’s daughter and her Austrian mother. After the national 
government came into existence the INA men were paid such pension 
and other benefits as were due to them for the period of their service 
in the Indian army. 

Events have proved the correctness of Nehru’s assessments and the 
wisdom of his stand on national and international issues from 1937 on- 
^ wards. Subhas Chandra Bose emerged, no doubt, as a great patriot 
with indomitable courage; but he was destined to fail. As in the case of 
the lives of many illustrious men there was an element of tragedy in the 
destiny of Bose. Future generations will remember Subhas Chandra 
Bose as India’s tragic hero of the twentieth century. 



9 Rajiv and Sanjay 


Of all the illusions of Indira, the one about her children is the most 
pathetic. A little before the declaration of the emergency in 1975 she 
spoke, with pride, of her achievements in bringing up her two children, 
Rajiv and Sanjay,- as serious-minded and dedicated young men. 

Towards the end of 1945 my picture of Rajiv is that of a ciy^-baby 
crawling on all hours. I have never come across a child who could cry 
so much and so perpetually as little Rajiv did. Sanjay was not in this 
world when I joined Nehru. Sanjaj' was bom in New Delhi at the 
Willtngdon Nursing Home and Hospital at 9.27 a.m. Indian Standard 
Time on 14 December 1946 with Makara Lagna and Simha Rasi. I 
give these details for the benefit of astrologers who are bound to 
pursue him. 

Rajiv was a sensitive child more dependent qn the mother than 
Sanjay who was an extrovert. Both were very lovable children. They 
would come to me often with their little problems and quarrels. 
Panditji had noted that the children were invariably with me whenever 
he strayed into my study in the Prime Mim'ster's House. Once, when 
the Prime Minister asked Indira at the breakfast table to accompany 
him on a somewhat lengthy tom in India, she tried to excuse herself 
by saying that the children would miss her. He promptly said, in the 
presence of the guests, “they will miss orJy Mac; I have noticed that 
they are always with him.” Indira was understandably annoyed; but 
ultimately she went with her father because she was, in her own way, 
devoted to him. Before she left on that tour, she told me what her 
father had told her at the breakfast table in the presence of guests 
about the children's attachment to me. She hoped that I would keep 
it up when she is awaj'. During her absence I w ent out of mj' way to 
take the kids to India Gate one evening to buy baloons and ice cream 
and the next day to Okhla for fishing. The third day I took them for 
sw'imming in the Rashtrapati Bhavan swimming pool. 

The children found out that I did not care for apples and that I kept 
whatever apples that came to me with my meals in the top drawyer 
of my writing desk. They would walk away with them during my 
absence. 

As a child it was Rajiv’s ambition to be a pilot. Later he changed his 



62 


My Days with Nehru 

mind and wanted to be a scientist. As a little boy Rajiv liked nothing 
better than a mechanical toy plane, which could be made to fly as a 
birthday present. 

Indira tried hard to make the children call me ‘■'Uncle Mac,” but 
failed. They preferred to call me “Mr Mathai.” 

Rajiv and Sanjay were sent to a private kindergarden school in New 
Delhi run by a Hungarian woman married to a Punjabi. The first look 
at her evoked revulsion in me. I told Indira that the teacher looked 
like an amazon and that she might be a vampire. But Indira was taken 
in by her. The teacher became a constant visitor. After some time the 
children were withdrawn from the kindergarden and sent to Welham 
Preparatory School in Dehra Dun. But the Hungarian woman teacher 
continued to be a frequent visitor to Indira. One day, while Indira was 
alone in her room, the Hungarian woman asked her for some favour 
which Indira could not do. The woman got wild and physically 
attacked Indira using her Ssts. She was a big-built woman. Indira tras 
so taken unawares that she did not know what to do. At last she 
shouted for the servants who dragged the amazon out of the room. In 
the evening I found Indira’s face badly swollen. She told me the 
whole story. This was the end of the Hungarian woman teacher’s visits 
to the Prime Minister’s house. 

While Rajiv and Sanjay were little children, I told Indira of the 
danger of the kids being spoilt by staying in a big house with numer- 
ous servants and other facilities, and the likelihood of their growing 
up with wrong ideas and values and taking many things for granted. 
However, she could do little about it. The children grew up as rather 
self-centred boys with little thought or consideration for others. They 
grew up in an atmosphere which instilled in them the wrong idea that 
the rest of the world was made for them. To say “thank you” did not 
come naturally to them. They developed no family feelings or family 
ties. 

While Rajiv and Sanjay were small, Nehru bought for them a pony 
which was named “Bijli.” She was a nice light-framed filly good with 
the children. When the children grew up, I bought a medium-sized 
black horse from Gwalior. He was a “black beauty” and was named 
“Timbuktu.” With the arrival of “Timbuktu,” “Bijli” was presented 
to the President’s Body Guard for the use of little children. Rajiv and 
Sanjay were happy with “Timbuktu” and Nehru also occasionally 
rode that horse. 

One summer day I took Rajiv and Sanjay for a swim in the 
Rashtrapati Bhavan Swimming Pool, Rajiv knew a little swimming 
while Sanjay wanted me to teach him. I told him that I would do 



Jiajiv and Sanjay 


63 


so exactly as my father taught me swimming while I was a little boy of 
his size. I said, “I will take you in my arms and throw you a little dis- 
itance away where the water is deep. From that distance you use your 
‘hands and feet and move towards me with confidence. Don’t be afraid, 
I am here to protect you.” I threw him; he got a fright and went down 
like a stone. I had to dive and rescue him. Some water got into his 
limgs. He was very angry and started crying and threatening to report 
to “mummie.” When he quietened down, I asked him: “What can 
mummie do to me?” He said, “She will beat you.” I asked him: 
■“Suppose I beat her?” He said with vehemance: “I will kick you and 
ibite you.” I said: “Good; you are right; you should always defend 
;mummie and never put youmelf in a position where mummie has to 
•defend you.” After this talk Sanjay decided not to report to “mummie” 
about the swimming episode. 

Sanjay used to give me advance intimation about what I should give 
him on his birthdays. He wanted only money. I told him that this was 
a sensible practice which Bernard Shaw had adopted and that I would 
follow it. Then I explained to him who Bernard Shaw was. 

One day, while I was in my study dictating to a PA, Sanjay came 
and quietly sat in my lap. As 1 finished dictation, he asked the PA 
what his name was. He replied “Goel.” Quick came the reply: “I do 
■not like you because you lay your eggs in other birds’ nests!” (“Goel” 
sounds like Koel which is the Hindi word for cuckoo ) 

Once, while the Prime Minister was out of Delhi, Sanjay wanted me 
to take him alone to India Gate to buy a large hydrogen baloon, a kite 
and, incidentally, a Coca Cola or an ice cream. So we drove to India 
Gate. On the way Sanjay saw a Sikh taxi-driver negotiating a “round- 
about” at break-neck speed in front of our car. Sanjay got annoyed, 
stuck his neck out and yelled “Bara Baje” (twelve o’ clock). I gave 
him a slap and scolded him. Little did I know then that the brat, when 
he grew up, was to marry the daughter of a “Bara Baje”! 

After breakfast one morning, while Rajiv, Sanjay and I were watch- 
ing the coloured fishes in the two large tanks I had set up for the kids, 
■the Prime Minister quietly came from behind, caught hold of Sanjay, 
threw him up in the air and then held him. The Prime Minister asked 
him: “Sanjay, where would you like to live? Delhi, Allahabad, or 
Lucknow?” Quick came the most appropriate reply: “Nana, I would 
like to live where you are.” The Prime Minister was immensly pleased. 
1 did not fail to pat Sanjay on the back. As a child, Sanjay was 
incredibly cute. 

One day at lunch Padmaja Naidu made a feeble attempt to make 
.5anjay a “vegetarian.” She told him how cruel and wicked it was to 



64 


My Days with Nehru 

kill chicken and sheep. He promptly silenced Padmaja by saying; “I 
don’t kill them; I eat only dead chicken and mutton!” 

On a Sunday afternoon I took Rajiv and Sanjay to Okhla for fish- 
ing. Ambassador A.C.N. Nambiar (Uncle Nanu for the children) also 
came with us. 1 had provided the children with improvised fishing out- 
■ fits. Rajiv got a medium-sized fish. Then there was a big pull on 
Sanjay’s rod. He was excited and managed, to land one; but it 
happened to be a small tortoise. He was deeply disappointed. In dis- 
gust he threw the tortoise back into the water after extricating it from 
the hook. We stayed on in the hope that Sanjay would get a fish; but 
he was unlucky. It was getting late and 1 told the boys that it was time 
to go home. Sanjay whispered into my ears that he would like me to 
buy a fish from the fisherman around so that he could take it home. I 
bought one which was slightly bigger than the fish caught by Rajiv. 
Sanjay asked Rajiv not to tell anyone that his fish was bought from a 
fisherman. I told Rajiv not to spoil Sanjay’s fun for one day. Bothtlie 
boys arrived home and showed “mummie” their respective catches. 
Rajiv kept his promise for a little while. But, when the Prime Minister 
appeared for dinrrer, Rajiv could not contain himself any longer. He 
said: “Nana, Sajay caught only a tortoise; the fish he brought home is 
one which Mr Mathai bought for him from a fisherman..” Sanjay was 
lived with rage, but he could do little in the presence of the grand- 
father except to say that he would have caught a fish if uncle Nanu had 
not thrown stones frequently into the river 

From Welham both the boys went to Doon School. Rajiv completed 
his course and passed the senior cambride examination. He was sent 
to England where he managed to pass the entrance examination 
to Cambridge. At Cambridge the authorities found that Rajiv hadn’t 
got it in him to make the grade. So he was “sent dow'n.” Then he 
managed to get admission to the Imperial College, London, from 
where also he was “sent down.” Crest-fallen, he returned to India. His 
ambition of becoming a scientist was dashed to the ground So he had 
to revert to his childhood love — to become a pilot. And a pilot he is 
now. The only success he had in England was to find an Italian wife. 
As I take leave of Rajiv in this chapter, past memories crowd in on me. 

I wish him well and safety in flying. 

Sanjay did not complete his Senior Cambridge in Dehra Dun. With 
tuition and other stufiings he managed to pass it in Delhi. 

The last book Nehru read was. Afj Life and Work by Henry Ford. 

I had acquired it from an old second-hand book-shop and found it 
fascinating. I knew Nehru would like the book; so I lent it to him in 
October:1963. On 14 .October 1963 he wrote to me: .

My dear Hathal, 

Some time ago, you were good enough to send 
me Henry Ford's books "My Life and Work". Owing to- 
heavy work I was unable to give much time to it, 
but I have read a little more than half of it. I 
hope to finish it fairly soon.' 


Thank you for sending it to me. I have 
enjoyed reading it.

I learn’t later that he was keeping the book by his side in his bed- 
room. After his death I tried to retrieve the book. But it had disappear- 
ed from the room. I was told later that the book was with Sanjay. I 
never got back the book. So, in a sense, I am responsible for Sanjay’s 
dream of a small car, the dismal failure of Maniti, and the enormity 
of the losses the project had inflicted on innumerable people including 
prospective distributors. Little Sanjay did not have the intelligence ta 
realize that conditions under which Henry Ford laboured in his back- 
yard as a mechanic for evolving a car were totally different from what 
they are now and that they cannot be reproduced. 

After Indira joined the government headed by Lai Bahadur, Sanjay 
was sent to England to work in a Ro//s Royce factory with a view tc 
pursuing his drerm of becoming a Henry Ford. Before he left, I rang 
up Indira and asked her to send the boy to me. I was then staying at 
No. 2 President’s Estate. Sanjay came the next evening and spent some 
time with me and we later went to a restaurant for a tandoori 



66 


My Days with Nehru 

chicken dinner. I discovered that Indira Iiad done Uitle to equip the 
the boy for the English winter. 1 gave him my heavy overcoat, a fine 
leather jacket, gloves, socks, ties, vests and several other items of 
European clothing. That is the last time I met him. Neither Rajiv nor 
Sanjay possesses warmth of human feelings. Nor were they trained to 
foster normal human relationships. 

It turned out that after one year’s apprenticeship with Nol/s Royce, 
Sanjay’s performance deteriorated. His performance was considered 
unsatisfactory by the company. So the representatives of Rolls Royce 
visited the Indian High Commissioner in London and suggested that 
any further time spent by Sanjay with the company would be mutually 
unprofitable. Soon after. Rolls Royce terminated the apprenticeship. 
So he had to return; but care was taken to give wide publicity in 
India that Sanjay was returning as he felt that Rolls Royce had 
nothing more to teach him! ■ He started, as Henry Ford did, as a 
mechanic in some hole in a wall in Old Delhi with hoodlums and a - 
character called Arjan Das, Any mechanic can make a contraption 
of an engine, buy parts from the market, put them together and call it 
a car which could move. And that exactly is what Sanjay produced. 
To organize a modern assembly line is a different matter.,That is what 
the boy never learned. And that is what unscrupulous industrialists 
knew but never told the boy, and continued to pour in money not on 
sound business considerations but for considerations of long-range 
schemings. Maruti was a blunder bound to flop. 

Then came the emergency. Sanjay, who hasn’t the making of a 
politician in him, was launched into politics by the mother who had 
developed dynastic ambitions. She did not realize that somebody would 
quote Carlyle and say of Sanjay; “Politics is the last refuge of the 
scoundrel.” And Sanjay was groomed for dynastic succession, and 
many goofs who were cabinet ministers and chief ministers and other 
important functionaries vied with each other to parade the boy before 
the public at government expense as the saviour and future ruler of 
India. For example, Sanjay’s visits to different parts of Uttar Pradesh 
from 26 June 1975' to 22 March 1977, cost the state government 
Rs 20.49 lakhs. This was subsequently disclosed in the State Vidhan 
Sabha. For Sanjay’s visit to Kothagudam in Andhra Pradesh, the 
government-owned Singareni Collieries spent Rs 5.5 lakhs. The col- 
lieries had spent only Rs 10,000 during President Rajendra Prasad’s 
visit to the same place. These were admitted before the Vimadalal 
Commission of Enquiry. 

Indira informally arranged that Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, 
Punjab and Madhya Pradesh in particular shall be Sanjay’s jagir. And 



Rajiv and Sanjay

the jagirdar performed miracles and perpetrated inhuman atrocities on 
the people. As Justice M.C. Chagla said; “It was a war on the people” 
by Indira, and Sanjay was the principal perpetrator of crimes. If 
Indira and Sanjay were not thrown out by the electorate in March 
1977, India might have had in Sanjay its own sadist and maniac like 
Ivan the T errible. 

Little wonder that Justice J.C. Shah described Sanjay’s role as the 
^‘single greatest act of excess committed during the emergency. ’’Justice 
Shah observed: “Here was a young man who literally amused himself 
with demolishing residential, commercial and industrial buildings in 
locality after locality without having the slightest realization of the 
miseries he was heaping on the helpless population.” 

I have often wondered whether the people of India, 'after.&gt;the 
emergency, are missing Sanjay and the bearded Dhirendra, "the 
so-called Brahmachari, on the TV. 

At. the time of writing, it looks obvious that for Sanjay the futufc 
is unknown and full of perils. I feel sad that such a fate should have 
come to him. All I can wish him is courage and fortitude to go 
through whatever fate and circumstances have in store for him. The 
memory of Sanjay that will abide with me is that of a lively and 
delightful little boy the like of whom I have not seen anywhere. 

An absurd story has gained currency that Sanjay once slapped his 
mother. This is totally unbelievable insofar as I am concerned. Only 
fools will believe such stories. This reminds me of a story of the 
opposite type about mythical Parvati and her two children Kartikeya 
and Ganesh. Both the boys were fascinated by the necklace Parvati 
was wearing and asked for it. Parvati did not want to show partiality. 
So she said: “Whoever goes round the universe and comes back to me 
first will get it.” The dashing Kartikeya at once flew on his peacock; 
Ganesh, with his little mouse, went round the mother and claimed the 
necklace. Parvati was surprised and asked Ganesh to explain. Ganesh 
confidently said: “For me you are the universe; none else exists.” 
Parvati promptly gave the necklace to him. The love, respect, and de- 
votion to the mother are as strong in Sanjay as in Ganesh; and that is 
the case with Rajiv also. 



10 Dr Sampurnanand and Basic Thinking 


Dr Sampurnanand had the look of a person who had walked out of 
the pages of our shastras. He was wejl versed in Indian history and 
in all aspects of our ancient culture. Himself a non-Brahmin, he pas- 
sionately believed that he was a Brahmin by accomplishment and that 
in ancient times no one was a Brahmin by the mere accident of birth 
and that caste was interchangeable. With his long hair and all the ex- 
ternal markings of Brahminism, he looked a fierce Brahmin. He was 
not an obscurantist. Sometimes he has reminded me of Napoleon 
Bonaparte who once described himself as “Corsican by birth, French 
by adoption, and emperor by achievement.” 

Dr Sampurauand was a typical example of Plato's conception of 
the scholar in politics. Nehru once told me that Sampurnanand was 
a person whose intellect was so razor-sharp that a slight tilt could 
make him mad. I have heard several junior colleagues of Dr Sampur- 
nanand, such as Lai Bahadur and Dr B. V. Keskar, speak in great 
veneration of Dr Sampurnanand. He succeeded Pandit Govind 
Ballabh Pant as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh when the latter 
joined the Union Cabinet. But the “Brahmin by achievement” did not 
have the infinite patience and capacity to suffer fools which the “Brah- 
min by birth” possessed in abundance. Apart from all aspects of 
India’s hoary past, including astrology. Dr Sampurnanand had an 
abiding interest in books on scientific fiction. He always kept a few 
of these books by his side in the Chief Minister’s office. It was notun- 
common for him to open one of them and go on reading while some- 
on'e, who came by appointment, was sitting in front of him feeling 
exasperated. Dr Sampurnanand ’s Chief Ministership did not last very 
long. He was quietly shifted from Uttar Pradesh and sent as Governor 
of Rajasthan where he had ample time and opportunities to explore its 
annals and antiquities. 

Early in 1957, while he was still Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, 
he attended the meetings of the Congress Working Committee in New 
Delhi. He asked for an informal meeting of interested members of the 
Congress Working Committee to discuss basic questions. Nehru liked 
the idea, and more than one meeting took place at the Prime Minis- 



Dr Sampurnanand and Basic Thinking 


69 


ter’s House. Dr Sampurnanand, apart from Nehru, was an active par- 
ticipant. 

The discussion covered many topics such as meaning of life, reli- 
gion, rationalism, science, communism, fascism, socialism, capitalism, 
welfare state, Vendantic life force, moral and spiritual disciplines, vio- 
lance, class conflict, means and ends, nationalism and planning. 

After these informal meetings Dr Sampurnanand requested Nehru 
to prepare a note on the discussions for the benefit of a wider circle 
of Congressmen. The note, written early in 1957, is reproduced below 
in full: 

We have many grave internal problems to face. But even a con- 
sideration of these internal problems inevitably leads to a wider 
range of thought. Unless we have some clarity of vision or, at any 
rate, are clear as to the questions posed to us, we shall not get out 
of the confusion that aflSicts the world today. I do not pretend 
to have that clarity of thinking or to have any answer to our major 
questions. All I can say, in all humility, is that I am constantly thin- 
king about these questions. In a sense, I might say that I rather 
envy those who have got fixed ideas and, therefore, need not take 
the trouble to look deeper into the problems of todaj'. Whether it is 
from the point of view of some religion or ideology, they are not, 
troubled with the mental conflicts which are always the accompani- 
ment of the great ages of transition. 

And yet, even though it may be more comfortable to have fixed 
ideas and be complacent, surely that is not to be commended, and 
that can only lead to stagnation and decay. The basic fact of today 
is the tremendous pace of change in human life. In my own life, I 
have seen amazing changes, and I am sure that in the course ofthe 
life of the next generation these changes will be even greater if 
humanity is not overwhelmed and annihilated by an atomic war. 

Nothing is so remarkable as the progressive conquest of under- 
standing of the .physical world by the mind of man today, and this 
process is continuing at a terrific pace. Man need no longer be a 
victim of external circumstances, at any rate, to a very large extent. 
While there has been this conquest of external conditions, there is 
at the same time the strange spectacle of a lack of moral fibre and of 
self-control in man as a whole. Conquering the physical world, he 
fails to conquer himself. 

This is the tragic paradox of this atomic and sputnik age. The 
fact that nuclear tests continue, even though it is well recognized 
‘.hat they are very harmful in the present and in the future, the fact 



70 


My Days with Nehm 

that all kinds of weapons of mass destruction are being produced 
and piled up, even though it is universaJJyrecognized that their use 
may well exterminate the human race, brings out this paradox with 
startling clarity. Science is advancing far beyond the comprehension 
of a very great part of the human race, and posing problems which 
most of us are incapable of understanding, much less of solving. 
Hence the inner conflict and tumult of our times. On the one side,' 
there is this great and overpowering progress in science and techno- 
logy and of their manifold consequences; on the other, a certain 
mental exhaustion of civilization itself. 

Religion comes into conflict with rationalism. The disciplines of 
religion and social usage fade away without giving place to other 
disciplines, moral or spiritual. Religion, as practised, either deals 
with matters rather unrelated to our normal lives and thus adopts 
an ivory tower attitude, or is allied to certain social usages which 
do not fit in with the present age. Rationalism, on the other hand, 
with all its virtues, somehow appears to deal with the surface of 
things, without uncovering the inner core. Science itself has arrived 
at a stage when vast new possibilities and mysteries loom ahead. 
Matter and energy and spirit seem to overlap. 

la the ancient days, life was simpler and more in contact with 
nature. Now it becomes more and more complex, and more hurried, 
without lime for reflection or even for questioning. Scientific 
development have produced an enormous surplus of power and 
energy which are often used for wrong purposes. 

The old question still faces us, as it has faced humanity for ages 
past; what is the meaning of life? The old days of faith do not 
appear to be adequate, unless they can answer the questions of to- 
day. In a changing world, living should be a continuous adjustment 
to these changes and happenings. It is the lack of this adjustment 
that creates conflicts. 

The old civilizations, with the many virtues that they possess have 
■ obviously proved inadequate. The new western civilization, with all 
its triumphs and achievements and also with its atomic bornbs, also 
appears inadequate and, therefore, a feeling grows that there is 
something wrong with our civilization. Indeed, essentially our pro- 
blems are those of civilization itself. Religion gave a certain moral 
and spiritual discipline; it also tried to perpetuate superstition and 
social usages. Indeed, those superstitions and social usages enmes- 
hed and overwhelmed the real spirit of religion. DisiUvsionwent 
followed. Communism comes in the wake of this disillusionment 
and offers some kind of faith and some kind of discipline. To

some extent it fills a vacuum. It succeeds in some measure by giving 
a content to man’s life. But in spite of its apparent success, it fails; 
partly because of its rigidity, but even more so, because it ignores 
certain essential needs of human nature. There is much talk in 
communism of the contradictions of capitalist society, and there 
is truth in that analysis. But we see the growing contradictions with- 
in the rigid framework of communism itself. Its suppression of in-. 
dividual freedom brings about powerful reactions. Its contempt for 
what might be called the moral and spiritual side of life, not only 
ignores something that is basic in man, but also deprives human 
behaviour of standards and values. Its unfortunate association with 
violence encourages a certain evil tendency in human beings. 

I have the greatest admiration for many of the achievements of 
the Soviet Union. Among these great achievements is the value 
attached to the child and the common man. Their systems of educa- 
tion and health are probably the best in the world. But, it is said, 
and rightly, that there is suppression of individual freedom there. 
And yet the spread of education in all its forms is itself a tremend- 
ous, liberating force which ultimately will not tolerate that 
suppression of freedom. This again is another contradiction. Unfor- 
tunately communism became too closely associated with the neces- 
sity for violence, and thus the idea which it placed before the world 
became a tainted one. Means distorted ends. We see here the power- 
ful influence of wrong means and methods. 

Communism charges the capitalist structure of society with being 
based on violence and class conflict. I think this is essentially correct, 
though that capitalist structure itself has undergone and is conti- 
nuously imdergoing a change because of democratic and other 
struggles and inequality. The question is how to get rid of this and 
have a classless society with equal opportunities for all. Can this 
be achieved through methods of violence, or can it be possible 
to bring about those changes through peaceful methods? Com- 
munism has definitely allied itself to the approach of violence. Even 
if it does not indulge normally in physical violence, its language is 
of violence, its thought is violent, and it does not seek to change by 
persuasion or peaceful democratic pressures, but by coercion and, 
indeed, by destruction and extermination. Fascism has all these evil 
aspects of violence and extermination in their grossest forms and, 
at the same time, has no acceptable ideal. 

This is completely opposed to the peaceful approach which 
Gandhiji taught us. Communists as well as anti-communists seem 
to imagine that a principle can only be stoutly defendedby language 



12 


My Days with Nehru 

of violence, and by condemning those who do not accept it. For both 
of them there are no shades, there is only black and white. That is the 
old approach of the bigoted aspects of some religions. It is not the 
iipproach of tolerance, of feeling that perhaps others might have some 
share of thetruth also. Speakingform} self, Ifind this approach whol- 
ly unscientific, unreasoiiable, and uncivilized, whether it is applied in 
the realm of religion, or economic theory, or anything else. J prefer 
the old pagan approach of tolerance, apart from its religious aspects. 
But whatever we may think about it, we have arrived at a stage in 
the modern world when an attempt at forcible imposition of ideas 
on any large section of people is bound ultimately to fail. In present 
circumstances, this will lead to war and tremendous destruction. 
There will be no victory, only defeat for everyone. Even this we 
have seen in the last year or two, that it is not easy for even great 
powers to reintroduce colonial control over territories which have 
recently become independent. This was exemplified by the Suez 
incident in 1956. Also what happened in Hungary demonstrated that 
the desire for national freedom is stronger even than any ideology, 
and cannot ultimately be suppressed. What happened in Hungary 
was not essentially a conflict between communism and anti-commu- 
nism. It represented nationalism striving for freedom from foreign 
control. 

Thus, violence cannot possibly lead today to a solution of any 
major problem because violence has become much too teirible and 
destructive. The moral approach to this question has now been 
powerfully reinforced by the practical aspect. 

If the society we aim at cannot be brought about by big-scale 
violence, will small-scale violence help? Surety not, partly because it 
produces an atmosphere of conflict and of disruption. It is absurd 
to imagine that out of conflict the socially progressive forces 
are bound to win. In Germany, both the Communist Party and the 
Social Democratic Party were kept away by Hitler. This may well 
happen in other countries too. In India, any appeal to violence is 
particularly dangerous because of its inherent disruptive character. 
We have too many fissiparous tendencies for us to take risks. But 
all these are relatively minor considerations. The basic thing, 

I believe, is that wrong means will not lead to right results, and that 
is no longer merely an ethical doctrine but a practical proposition. 

Some of us have been discussing this general background and, 
more especially, conditions in India. It is often said that there is a 
sense of frustration and depression in India and the old buoyancy 
of spirit is not to befound at a time when enthusiasm and hard work 



Dr Sanipurnanand and Basic Thinking

are most needed. This is not merely in evidence in our country, it is 
in a sense a world phenomenon. An old and valued colleague said 
that this is due to our not having a philosophy of life, and indeed 
the world also is suffering from this lack of a philosophical 
approach. In our efforts to ensure the material prosperity of 
the country, we have not paid any attention to the spiritual element 
in human nature. Therefore, in order to give the individual and the 
nation a sense of purpose, something to live for and, if necessary to 
die for, we have to revive some philosophy of life and give, in the 
wider sense of the word, a spiritual background to our thinking. 
We talk of a Welfare State and of democracy and of socialism. 
They are good concepts, but they hardly convey a clear and 
unambiguous meaning. This was the' argument, and then the 
question arose as to what our ultimate objective would be. Demo- 
cracy and socialism are means to an end, not the end itself. We talk 
•of the good of society. Is this something apart from the transcend- 
ing the good of the individuals composing it? If the individual is 
ignored and sacrificed for what is considered the good of the society, 
is that the right objective to have? 

It was agreed that the individual should not be so sacrificed and, 
indeed, that real social progress will come only when opportunity 
is given to the individual to develop, provided the individual is not 
a selected group but comprises the whole community. The touch- 
stone, therefore, should be how far any political or social theory 
enables the individual to rise above his petty self and thus think in 
terms of the good of all. The law of life should not be competition 
or acquisitiveness, but co-operation, the good of each contributing 
to the good of all. In such a society the emphasis will be on duties, 
not on rights; the rights will follow the performance of the duties. 
We have to give a new direction to education and evolve a new type 
of humanity. 

The argument led to the old Vedantic conception that every- 
thing, whether sentient or insentient, finds a place in the organic 
whole, that everything has a spark of what might be called the 
divine impulse, or that the basic energy or life force pervades the 
universe. This leads to metapnysical regions which tends to take us 
away from the problems of life which face us. I suppose that any 
line of thought, sufficiently pursued, leads us in some measure 
to metaphysics. Even science today is almost on the verge of 
all manner of imponderables. I do not propose to discuss these 
metaphpsical aspects, but this very argument indicates how the 
mind searches for something basic underlying the physical world. If 



74 


My Days with Nehru 

we really believe in this all-pervading concept of the principle of 
life, it might help us to get rid of some of our narrowness of race, 
caste, or class, and make us more tolerant and understanding in our 
approaches to life’s problems. 

But obviously, it does not solve any of these problems, and in a 
sense, we remain where we were. In India we talk of the welfare 
state and socialism. In a sense, every country, whether it is capita- 
list, socialist or communist, accepts the ideal of the welfare stale. 
Capitalism, in a few countries at least, has achieved this common 
welfare to a very large extent, though it has far from solved its own 
problems, and there is a basic lack of something vital. Democracy 
allied to capitalism has undoubtedly toned down many of its evils, 
and, in fact, is different now from what it was a generation or two 
ago. In industrially advanced countries, there has been a continuous 
and steady upward trend of economic development. Even the terri- 
ble losses of the World War have not prevented this trend in so far 
as these highly developed countries are concerned. Further, this 
economic development has spread, though in varying degrees, to all 
classes. This does not apply to countries which are not industrially 
developed. Indeed, in those countries the struggle for development 
is very difficult and .sometimes, in spite of efforts, not only, do 
economic inequalities remain, but tend to become worse. Normally 
speaking, it may be said that the forces of a capitalist society, if left 
unchecked, tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer, and 
thus increase the gap between them. This applies to countries as well 
as groups, or regions, or classes within the countries. Various demo- 
cratic processes interfere with these normal trends. Capitalism itself 
has, therefore, developed some socialistic features even though its 
major aspects remain. 

Socialism, of course, deliberately wants to interfere with the 
normal processes and thus not only adds to the productive forces, 
but lessens inequalities. But, what is socialism? It is difficult to give 
a precise answer and there are innumerable definitions of it. Some 
people probably think of socialism vaguely just as something which 
does good and which aims at equality. That does not take us very 
far. Socialism is basically a different approach from that of capita- 
lism, though I think it is true that the wide gap between them tends 
to lessen because many of the ideas of socialism arc gradually 
incorporated even in the capitalist structure. Socialism is after all 
not only a way of life, but a certain scientific approach to social 
and economic problems. If socialism is introduced in a backward 
and under-developed country, it does not suddenly make it any less 



Dr Sampurnanand and Basic Thinking 


75 


backward. In fact, we then have a backward and poverty stricken 
socialism. 

Unfortunately, many of the political aspects of communism 
have tended to distort our vision of socialism. Also the technique of 
struggle evolved by communism has given violence a predominant 
part. Socialism should, therefore, be considered apart from these 
political elements or the inevitability of violence. It tells us that the 
general character of social, political, and intellectual life in a 
society is governed by its productive resources. As those productive 
resources change and develop, so the life and thinking of the 
community changes. 

Imperialism or colonialism suppressed and suppresses the pro- 
gressive social force. Inevitably it aligns itself with certain privileged 
groups or classes because it is interested in preserving the social and 
economic status quo. Even after a country has become independent, 
it may continue to be economically dependent on other countries. 
This kind of thing is euphemistically called having close cultural 
and economic ties. 

We discuss sometimes the self-sufficiency of the village. This 
should not be mixed up with that idea of decentralization though it 
may be a part of it. While decentralization is, I think, desirable to 
the largest possible extent, if it leads to old and rather primitive 
methods of production, then it simply means that we do not utilize 
modern methods which have brought great material advance to 
some countries of the West. That is, we remain poor and, what is 
more, tend to become poorer because of the pressure of an increas- 
ing population. I do not see any way out of our vicious circle 
of poverty except by utilizing the new sources of power which 
Science has placed at our disposal. Being poor, we have no surplus 
to invest and we sink lower and lower. 

We have to break through this barrier by profiting by the new 
source of power and modern techniques. But, in doing so, we should 
not forget the basic human element and the fact that our objective 
is individual improvement and the lessening of inequalities, and we 
must not forget the ethical and spiritual aspects of life which are 
ultimately the basis of culture and civilization and which have given 
some meaning to life. 

It has to be remembered that it is not by some magic adoption of 
socialist or capitalist method that poverty suddenly leads to riches. 
The only way is through hard work and increasing the productivity 
of the nation and organizing an equitable distribution of its products. 
It is a lengthy and difficult process. In a poorly developed country. 



76 


My Days with Nehru 

the capitalist method offers no chance. It is only through a planned 
approach on socialistic lines that steady progress can be attained 
though even that will take time. As this process continues, 
the texture of our life and thinking gradually changes. 

Planning is essential for this because otherwise we waste our 
resources, which are very limited. Planning does not mean a mere 
collection of projects, or schemes, but a thought-out approach of 
how to strengthen the base and pace of progress so that the com- 
munity advances on all fronts. In India we have a terrific problem 
of extreme poverty in certain large regions, apart from the general 
poverty in the country. We have always a difficult choice before us; 
whether to concentrate on production by itself in selected and 
favourable areas, and thus for the moment rather ignoring the poor 
areas, or try to develop the backward areas at the same time, so'as 
to lessen the inequalities between regions. A balance has to be 
struck and an integrated national plan evolved. That national plan 
need not and indeed should not have rigidity. It need not be based 
on any dogma, but should rather take the existing facts into consi- 
deration. It may, and I think in present day India, it should encour- 
age private enterprise in many fields, though even that private enter- 
prise must necessarily fit in with the national plan and have such 
controls as are considered necessary. 

Land reforms have a peculiar significance because without them, 
more especially in a highly congested country like India, there 
can be no radical improvement in productivity in agriculture. But 
the main object of land reforms is a deeper one. They are meant to 
break up the old class structure of a society that is stagnant. 

We want social security, but we have to recognize that social 
security only comes when a certain stage of development has been 
reached. Otherwise, we shall have neither social security nor 
any development. 

It is clear that in the final analysis, it is the quality of the human 
being that counts. It is man that builds up the wealth of a nation 
as well as its cultural progress. Hence education and health are of 
high importance so as to produce that quality in the human beings. 
We have to suffer here also from the lack of resources, but still we 
have always to remember that it is right education and good health 
that will giv'e the foundation for economic as well as cultural and 
spiritual progress. 

A national plan has thus both a short-term objective and a long- 
term one. The long-term objective gives a true perspective. Without 
it short-term planning is of little avail and will lead us into blind 



Dr Sampiirnanand and Basic Thinking 


77 


alleys. Planning will thus always be perspective planning and hard 
in view of the physical achievements for which we strive. In other 
words, it has to be physical planning, though it is obviously limited 
and conditioned be financial resources and economic conditions. 

The problems that India faces are to some extent common to 
other countries, but there are new problems for which we have not 
got parallels or historical precedents elsewhere. What has happened 
in the past in the industrially advanced countries has little bearing 
on us today. As a matter of fact, the countries that are advanced 
today were economically better off than India is today, in terms of 
per capita income, before their industrialization began. Western 
economics, therefore, though helpful, has little bearing on our 
present-day problems. So also is Marxist economics which is in 
many ways out of date, even though it throws considerable light on 
economic processes. We have thus to do our own thinking, profiting 
by the example of others, but essentially trying to find a path for 
ourselves suited to our own conditions. 

In considering these economic aspect of our problems, we have 
always to remember the basic approach of peaceful means, and per- 
haps we might also keep in view the old Vedantic ideal of the life 
force which is the inner base of everything that exists. 


Sdj- J. Nehru 



11 The Nehru Clan and a Brigadier 


In 1950 one Mrs Kala Madan of Allahabad, a near relative of Indira, 
came to stay in the Prime Minister’s House. This elderly woman was 
an agreeable person and a good sport. Her family had extensive 
landed properties in UP and other parts of northern India, some of 
which was under dispute. Her eldest son was in the army as a 
Lieutenant Colonel and serving as the Military Attache in Cairo at 
that time. The second son was young and not very bright. Mrs Madan 
was developing a farm in UP Terai for the second son. She needed 
money for it. 

With very rare exceptions Indira had no use for any relatives on 
her father’s side. One such exception was B.K. Nehru; the other was 
Mrs Kala Madan. Indira' had deep-seated hostility towards Vijaya 
Lakshmi Pandit and her daughters. In fact this hostility was mutual. 
In the family circle her goodwill was generally limited to those related 
to her mother. 

■ Indira aised to tell me that in spite of the fact that Motilal Nehru 
was a benevolent patriarch of the Nehru clan, they shied away from 
him and especially her father and herself during the days of the free- 
dom struggle. I told her that Peter, one of the disciples of Christ, 
denied him thrice when Christ was in trouble, saying for the third 
time, “I know not the man.” But very soon Peter repented, went out 
and wept bitterly. She replied that the members of the Nehru clan 
were calculating people. I also told Indira the story of a man whom 
the great German Chancellor Prince Bismarck had helped. After Bis- 
marck, “the old pilot,” was unceremoniously “dropped” by Kaiser 
Wilhelm II in 1890, he went on a holiday to Italy. There he came 
across the man who had prospered as a result of his help while ho 
was in power. Both happened to be taking a walk in Rome. The 
man crossed the road six times to avoid Bismarck. That was human 
nature perhaps at its worst. When a great Bengali personality was 
told that a particular man was inimical to him, he expressed surprise 
and commented: “But I do not remember to have done any good to 
him!” 

When Nehru became the Prime Minister, relatives were all over 
“Jawahar Bhai” and “Indu.” Nehru was too big a man to nurse 


The Nehru Clan and a Brigadier

petty grievances, but Indira could not shed her coldness and kept her 
distance. Members of the Nehru clan began to treat the Prime 
Minister’s House, the official residence in New Delhi, as a convenient 
Rest House. Sometimes they came in numbers and quarrelled with 
the staff for cars to roam about. Each one thought that he or she 
should have a separate car. I had to tell the Prime Minister that 
these people were not entitled to government transport and, in any 
event, there were not many cars available. He asked me to tell the 
staff to let them know that they had to hire taxis. The Prime Minis- 
ter, of course, paid for their food expenses personally — which itself 
was burden enough. 

While Jairamdas Daulatram was Minister of Food and Agriculture, 
Nehru took personal interest in developing and exploiting under- 
ground water resources in Rajasthan. The Jam Saheb of Navanagar 
sent a water diviner popularly know as “Paani Maharaj.” By strik- 
ing the ground with a stick, he could correctly predict where under- 
ground water was available The report on Paani Maharaj's experi- 
ments was encouraging. Jairamdas Daulatram, in consultation with 
the Rajasthan government, set up a Rajasthan Underground Water 
Board in the Union Ministry of Agriculture. At the instance of the 
Prime Minister. Jairamdas Daulatram put Kailas Nath Kaul in charge 
of it. Kaul was Kamala Nehru’s brother. He was supposed to spend 
most of his time in Rajasthan and work with Paani Maharaj in dose 
consultation with the Rajasthan government. A decent man but woe- 
fully lacking in executive and administrative Ability, he had some 
training in the Kew Gardens in England and was later in charge of a 
botanical garden in UP. The work in Rajasthan went on for about a 
year in a hap-hazard manner. Neither Daulatram nor any one else in 
the Union Agriculture Ministry' was enthusiastic about Kaul’s work. 
Ultimately Paani Maharaj felt disgusted and left. The Jam Saheb 
complained to the Prime Minister who got annoyed. He sent for Kaul 
and gave him a dressing down. Kaul blamed it all on the apathy of the 
Rajasthan government and the Government of India. Nehru told him 
that he had no use for men who had excuses for their failures. Kaul’s 
appointment was terminated and Rajasthan Underground Water 
Board was wound up. 

Kaul lay low for some time and later came up with a scheme for 
reclaiming land rendered unfit for cultivation due to excessive salt. He 
said there were millions of acres of such land in India with an unusu- 
ally large percentage in UP. As a cat, which had fallen in hot water, 
is suspicious of cold water, Nehru refused to be impressed. He asked 
Kaul to send him an estimate for a pilot scheme of reclaiming two 



80 


My Days with Nehru 


acres of such land near about his botanical garden in UP. Kaul sent 
the estimate. Money was sent to him for this purpose with instructions 
to keep the UP Agriculture Department in the picture so that it can 
take the responsibility for reclamation operations on a large scale. 
Nothing more was heard about this project. All the millions of acres, 
which Kaul surveyed in his imagination, must still be lying barren in 
UP and elsewhere. 

There was another character by the name ofP.N. Kathjuwho was 
also a very decent individual. He was a chemistry lecturer in a College 
in Agra and was married to the younger sister of Kamala Nehru. 
Indira was attached to this aunt. Kathju was a confused man who 
never know what he wanted to do in life. Neither did he know how to 
stick on to one thing and do sustained work. He remained an unstable 
rolling stone throughout his adult life. 

When Congress accepted office in the provinces under the Govern- 
ment of India Act 1935, Nehru sent Kathju to Dr Sye'd Mahmud in 
Patna where he was a minister. Kathju was appointed as an Adviser 
in the Department of Industries in the Government of Bihar. There is 
nothing on record to indicate that he was instrumental in developing 
any industry in Bihar or having done any other useful work. He did 
not remain there for long. He came away full of complaints against 
the rest of the world. Progressively he became cantankerous. 

When Nehru became Prime Minister, Kathju was at a loose end. 
Indira was anxious to see that something was done for Kathju. Nehru 
remained unmoved. At last he relented and spoke to Dr Shanti 
Swarup Bhatnagar who was then the Director-General of the Council 
of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). He set up a branch of 
the salt research institute in Jaipur and put Kathju in charge of it. 
After some time in Jaipur Kathju developed more interest in politics 
than in salt. Ultimately he left salt and joined politics and succeeded 
in getting elected to the Rajya Sabha for a six-year term. His 
contribution in Parliament consisted of a few questions concerning 
“irregularities” in the CSIR. 

, It was the exhibitionist and pushing socialite wife of a member of 
the Nehru clan belonging to the Indian Civil Service who inspired 
Shankar the cartoonist to start a cartoon “Mem Saheb.” Shankar, 
dragging M. Chalapathi Rau with him, had to go from one dobhie 
ghat to another in Delhi to draw the faces of two donkeys— one male 
and the other female. Shankar achieved remarkable success in 
investing the faces of the two donkeys the unmistakable likenesses of 
the husband and wife. People looked forward to seeing this cartoon 
every week in Shankar's Weekly. 



The Nehru Clan and a Brigadier

I started this chapter with Mrs Kala Madan who came to stay in 
the Prime Minister’s House in 1950. Indira was very keen to help 
Mrs Madan, and she spoke to me about it I told her that she knew 
very well that her father believed in the maxim “neither a borrower 
nor a lender be” and that, in any event, personally he was not flush 
with money. I asked Indira to find out what was the immediate mini- 
mum need of Mrs Madan. Indira asked Mrs Madan and later told 
me that Mrs Madan needed a minimum of Rs 5,000 immediately. I 
asked Indira why Mrs Madan's grown-up bachelor son, who was then 
the Military Attache in Cairo, could not send her the sum. She said 
“Nanna” Madan believed in living w'ell and forgetting others in the 
process. I finally told Indira that I could riot take up this matter 
with the Prime Minister but that I myself was prepared to give this 
sum to Mrs Madan as a loan. The next morning Mrs Madan met 
me and said that because of her urgent need she would gratefully 
accept the loan from me. She assured me that either she or her son. 
would repay the loan. I did not put any time limit. 

As I began this chapter with Mrs Kala Madan, I shall end it with 
her son. His name is Narendra Nath Madan who retired from the 
army some years ago as a Brigadier. When I met him in Cairo soon . 
after I gave the loan to his mother, he told me that his mother had 
informed him of the loan and that it would be repaid without much 
delay. 1 forgot all about it. 

■A month before I left Delhi for good in 1977, 1 remembered it. So 
I wrote to him on 30 September 1977 a letter reading as follows: 

You will recollect that over 25 years ago I gave a loan of 
Rs 5,000 to your mother. Some time after that you promised to 
repay the debt. I did not want to remind you while your financial 
position was not affluent. 

I am leaving Delhi for good on 29 October as I have no capacity 
to pay murderous rent in Delhi. There is considerable expenditure- 
involved in this shift. 

If you ask any banker, he will tell you that in 25 years Rs 5,000 
if invested in a bank, would have multiplied to Rs 30,000. Consi- 
dering the value of the rupee at the time of making the loan, the 
present value would be Rs 20,000. However, I do not wish to- 
fleece you. I suggest that you give me Rs 10,000 which I shall 
consider as full re-paymant of the loan. I believe you are now very 
affluent.

On 27 October 1977, Brigadier Madan replied to me as follows; 


Brigadier H. IT. Madan, 

B— 14/9 Vasant Yihar, 
npw DolM-57, 
27.10,1977. 


Bear Ur Kathal, 

Your letter of 30th September, 1977. I would 
have got in touch with you niuoh earlier; unfortunately, I 
have been' away from Belhi for nearly a month and a half, 
except for a couple of very abort visits. Aa a result, most 
of my mail has been follov/ing me around the countryside, IVhen 
I returned a couple of days ago, I found your letter awaiting 
me. 


Yes, I remember my mother having borrowed 
the money from you. In fact I was made aware of it within 
a few months of her having done ao and I also remember her 
telling me that she would look after it herself, as aome 
other people were involved in this transaction. Thereafter, 
since the matter never came up during the course of these 
many years, I naturally got Jthe impression that the problem 
had been solved. Its a pity that you did not remini me of 
this fact, earlier. If you check on your source of infor- 
mation, I have been affluent enough for over 20 years to 
have paid back this debt of my mother’s. And atleast 10 
years ago she could have done it herself. 


Please let me know your future addreaa and 
the name fo your Bankers so that I can send you a draft for 
the amount concerned. Although my mother expired nearly 
three years ago, I have not been able to trace any paper 
that might have given me an idea df what the term* and 
conditions of the loan were. 


i Youre siaoerely, 
fi-—- . 


I wrote to Brigadier Madan on 28 October giving him my 
Madras address and the other particulars he had asked for. On the

27 December 1977, I reminded him from Madras. He chose not to 
reply. 1 wrote again, but no reply. 

Brigadier Madan is too old to leafn the meaning of the dictum 
“life is to give, not to take.”

12 I Cause Nehru’s Resignation 


In July 1948 the Nizam of Hyderabad sent a letter to King George VI 
by ordinary post. In view of the trouble that was brewing in Hyderabad 
about accession to the Indian Union, an over-zealous customs officer 
intercepted the letter and opened it. Government instructed the Indian 
High Commissioner in London to explain the circumstances of the 
regretable incident to Buckingham Palace. The High Commissioner 
received a letter dated 29 July 1948 from the Private Secretary to the 
King reading as follows: 

The King has now given consideration to your letter to me of 
July 25th setting out the circumstances in which an envelope con- 
taining a letter addressed to bis Majesty by the Nizam of Hyderabad 
was opened by a Customs Officer in Delhi. 

The King accepts assurance given in your letter that no dis- 
courtesy to His Majesty was intended; he trusts, however, that the 
Prime Minister will take such steps as he may think fit to ensure 
that correspondence addressed to His Majesty is not so treated in 
the future. 

Close on the heels of this, a similar incident occurred — this time 
involving a letter from King George VI addressed to the Nizam of 
Hyderabad. On 6 August 1948 a sealed cover was received from 
Governor-General C. Rajagopalachari addressed to the Prime Minis- 
ter. As the cover was being delivered to me by an ADC to the 
Governor-General, the Prime Minister walked into my study. I 
opened the cover in which there were two smaller sealed envelopes. 
One I opened and, before I could glance through the papers, Nehru, 
in his impatience, snatched away the papers from me and began to 
read them. In the meantime I opened the second envelope also think- 
ing that too was addressed to the Prime Minister. By that time Nehru 
had learnt that the second envelope, which I had just opened, was a 
communication from the King addressed to the Nizam. Nehru was 
stunned and asked me in a low tone: “What have you done?” He was 
visibly upset and quietly walked away. If I had the opportunity to 
glance through the contents of the first envelop, I would have Icarn’t 



I Cause Nehru's Resignation 


85 


that the second envelope was not to be opened. But it was not to be. 
The first envelope contained a letter from the Governor-General ask- 
ing the Prime Mirnster to forward the second envelope (the King’s 
communication) to the Nizam expeditiously. The Governor- General 
had enclosed with his letter, for the information of the Prime Minister, 
a copy of the King’s communication to the Nizam dated 29 July 
1948 which read as follows: 

f 

Your Exalted Highness, 

I have received your Exalted Highness’s letter of July 4th, with 
which you enclosed a copy of a letter addressed to my Prime 
Minister in the United Kingdom. 

I continue to watch with interest and concern the course of the 
negotiations which have been in progress between my Government 
in the Dominion of India and the Government of Hyderabad re- 
garding the relationship of Hyderabad to the Union of India, and 
it is my earnest hope and prayer that a peaceful solution of the 
difficulties which have arisen may be found. 

I have also received your Exalted Highness’s second letter, dated 
July 19th; you may rest assured that this letter also will have my 
close attention. 

I sign myself your sincere friend, 

George R. 

To General His Exalted Highness 

Asaf Jah Muzaffar-uI-Mulk Wal Mamalik, 

Nizam-ul-Mulk Nizam-ud-Daula, 

Nawab Sir Mir, Usman Ali Khan, Bahadur, 

Fateh Jung, G.C.S.I., G.B.E. 

Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar. 

Even though the King’s letter was an inoccuous and routine 
acknowledgment and not of any urgency, the inadvertent opening of 
it caused extreme embarrassment to the Prime Minister. 

Nehru at first thought of sending to the Nizam the King’s letter 
with the opened envelope and apologizing to the Nizam for the 
inadvertent mistake; but the Governor-General advised against it. 
The Prime Minister accepted the Governor-General’s suggestion 
■ that the communication be sent back to the King explaining the 
circumstances and requesting that it be put in a new envelope and re- 
turned for despatch to the Nizam. 

Both the Governor-General and the Prime Minister sent “Humble 
Duty Submissions” to the King explaining the circumstances and con- 



86 


My Days with Nehru 


veying profound regrets and apologies. Nehru also sent a private 
message to Lord Mountbatten asking him to convey to the King 
informally his readiness to resign on account of the lapse. These were 
dated 7 August 1948. 

All such communications were sent through Sardar Balwant Singh 
Puri, Secretary-General of the Indian Red Cross Society, who was 
proceeding to London for other work. He delivered them to High 
Commissioner Krishna Menon. The King happened to be at Balmoral

Castle then. Krishna Menon decided to fly to Scotland to deliver the 
communications at Balmoral. Lord Mduntbatten advised against dis- 
turbing the King on his holiday. On the advice of Lord Mountbatten, 
the communications, along with a private letter from Lord Mountbat- 
ten addressed to the King, were delivered at Buckingham Palace on 
the evening of 9 August. They were sent by the special air-mail from 
Buckingham Palace to Balmoral and the papers were in the hands 
of the King shortly after 10 a.m. on 10 August. 

On 12 August 1948 the Right Hon’ble Sir Alan Lascelles, PC, 
KCVO, CB, CMG, Private Secretary to King George VI, wrote to the 
Prime Minister see page 86. 



1 3 Nehru and Industrialists 


Tie one and only Indian Industrialist, with whom Nehru was per- 
sonally friendly before independence was J.R.D. Tata. They were on 
terras of calling each other by first names. This personal relationship 
between the two and Nehru’s initial good opinion of the House of 
Tatas were primarily due to J.R.D. Tata’s life-long passionate interest 
in aviation, the readiness with which he started the Tata Institute of 
Fundamental Research with a view to providing research facilities to 
the promising young scientist Homi J. Bhabha before independence, 
and the contribution of the House of Tatas towards the promotion of 
science and medical research in India. 

After Nehru entered government, J.R.D. Tata was correct and 
always observed properties in dealing with Nehru. For example, he 
never discussed with the Prime Minister any problem confronting the 
business House of Tatas. His dealings were confined to overall poli- 
cies governing aviation and broad policies affecting industrial deve- 
lopment and production. 

It was on Nehru’s personal initiative that J.R.D. Tala was included 
several times in the Indian delegation to the United Nations General 
Assembly in the early years of independence. 

The relationship suffered a set-back when Indian internal airways 
were nationalized by Rafi Ahmed Kidv^ai. J.R.D Tata was bitterly 
opposed to it. 

The relationship was soured by two happenings: 

(1) On his return from a mission to the Federal Republic of 
Germany early in the fifties, Asok K. Chanda, Secretary in the Mini- 
stry of Production, personally reported to the Prime Minister that 
he ran into heavy weather with the German consortium for the pro- 
posed Rourkela Steel Plant because the Tatas, at a very high level, 
had succeeded in misleading the Germans about the need for a sepa- 
rate steel plant for India. As a result, the whole concept of the 
Rourkela Steel Plant had to be changed. German -financial participa- 
tion was dispensed with and ultimately the German consortium came 
in only as suppliers and contractors. Nehru was annoyed and upset 
by this episode. The relations between the Prime Minister and J.R.D. 
Tata were strained beyond repair. 



Nehru and Industrialists 


89 


(2) K.M. Mathulla, a chartered accountant who was controller 
•of Accounts of the Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (TISCO), 
disclosed to the Union Finance. Ministry a large-scale tax evasion by 
TISCO. This led to Mathulla’s services being terminated by TISCO. 
The Tatas found it prudent to desist from going to court about 
reassessment of tax and ultimately had to enter into a compromise 
•arrangement with the government whereby a sum of Rs 75 lakhs was 
paid to the government in settlement of the tax evasion. The Ministry 
of Production in the union government employed Mathula as a Joint 
Secretary and put him in charge of steel. This influriated J.R.D. Tata 
further. When a separate Ministry of Steel was created with T.T. 
Krishnamachari as Minister, Mathulla was transferred and appointed 
as Managing Director of Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) which 
was in doldrums at that time. When I first heard of MathuIIa’s 
employment in the Ministry of production, I had told the secretary of 
that ministry that he should not be allowed to claim his very sub- 
stantial “reward” from the Finance Ministry for his disclosure of tax 
evasion by TISCO, as long as he was connected with the government. 
I do not know if and when Mathulla drew the “reward” to which he 
was entitled. In Bangalore Mathulla earned the reputation of having 
served HMT and himself very well. 

About this time, when Nehru was full of Rourkela Steel Plant 
episode, T.T. Krishnamachari walked into my room in Parliament 
House and,- as he finished his businees with me, said he had some- 
thing to say to the Prime Minister. So we both went in. Nehru started 
talking about the Rourkela Steel Plant episode and about the attempt 
by some Parsi businessmen to smuggle substantial amounts out of 
India in foreign exchange as a prelude to migrating from the country. 
He ended up by saying; “Whatever may be the faults of theMarwaris, 
they are emotionally attached to this land; they want to die here; and 
they want their ashes to be immersed in the Ganga.” 

Nehru once told me of a revolting experience he had at a Parsi 
book-shop in Bombay. At that time he was a well-known person who 
svould collect a crowd whenever he went. He arrived at the book-shop 
and told the Parsi salesman at the counter what books he wished to 
buy. Instead of speaking to him politely and directing him to the 
appropriate counter, the man made a coarse “Yke” sound and showed 
his thumb in the direction of the counter to go to. Nehru commented 
to me; “Some of these Parsis should be sent to Lucknow to learn 
manners from ekkawallahs who are known for their innate cultured 
behaviour.” He was full of praise for the manners of the common 
people of Lucknow.

My Days with Nehru 


With the generality of businessmen and industrialists, both Indian 
and foreign, Nehru was not at home. He liked to avoid their calcula- 
tions, crudities and coarseness. To him, socially they were “outcastes.” 
The same was the case with the average run of Trade Union leaders. 
Nobody could persuade Nehru to give a reception to members of the 
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry on the 
Indian National Trade Union Congress during their annual sessions 
in New Delhi. One of the words Nehru disliked most was “lucrative.” 
The nearest word he would suffer himself to use was “profitable.” 
Nehru’s sensitiveness and definement, with all their implications, led 
some people to refer to his “lofty aloofness.” 



14 The Scientific Trio 


Sir Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar, Prof P.C. Mahalanobis and Dr Homi J. 
Bhabha were the scientists who played a prominent part in the fulfil- 
ment of Nehru’s cherished desire to rapidly develop science and tech- 
nology as instruments of economic development and social change in a 
tradition-boimd society. Nehru was anxious to sweep the cobwebs of 
superstition and obscurantism. He laid great stress in developing the 
scientific temper in the country. 

All the three men were Fellows of the Royal Society, Dr Bhabha 
being the youngest of them. 

Realising the importance of their work, Nehru was indulgent to 
them. The senior ICS officials mentally disapproved of Nehru spending 
so much time on them. These civil servants invented the bogy that the 
three scientists were exercising undue influence on the Prime Minister. 
In the initial stages they behaved towards these scientists as if they were 
heads of "attached offices” and would not treat them as anything more 
than Joint Secretaries. Naturally this produced reaction in the scien- 
tists. It took considerable time for ICS secretaries to the Government 
of India to come to the painful conclusion that they were no longer the 
rulers of India dealing directly with the Viceory over the heads of the 
dummy members of the Viceroy’s Executive Cormcil. Right from the 
beginning the three scientists received such consideration and courtsey 
from the Prime Minister, who was also in charge of scientific research, 
that they felt content that government, for the first time, attached more 
importance to their work than that of the bureaucrats. Gradually the 
emoluments and official position of scientists and technical men such 
as engineers, medical men and others were enhanced. 

Nehru did not come into direct touch with the work of Sir C.V. 
Raman, Dr M.N. Saha, the Indian Council for Medical Research and 
the Indian Cotmcil for Agriculture Research. Dr Saha was perpetually 
at logger-heads with Dr Bhatnagar and Dr Bhabha. He was on the 
verge of retiring from active scientific work. Progressively he grew 
cantankerous and strayed into politics for which he always had a pen- 
chant, while Sir C.V. Raman observed his loftly aloofness. The one 
Nehru personally liked most in the scientific community was Sir K.S. 
Krishnan who was soft-spoken, dignified and retiring. Undoubtedly he 



92 


My Days with Nehru 


was the most wholesome man among the scientists. 

When the question of including a distinguished scientist in the first 
list of Presidential nominees to the Rajya Sabha arose, Nehru inform- 
ally consulted several prominent people in the scientific community. 
He was anxious to have the most acceptable and the least controverisal 
person. All except Dr M.N. Saha opted for Prof Satyendra Nath Bose. 
Dr Saha’s stand reminded me of the attitude of the Cardinals in the 
election of the Pope in ancient times. In the first ballot each Cardinal 
received one vote— his own. In spite of Dr Saha, Prof S.N. Bose was 
nominated by the President, on the recommendation of the Prime 
Minister, as a member of the Rajya Sabha. 

Dr S.S. Bhatnagar 

He made his mark as a scientist for his research in Chemistry be- 
fore the second World War. During the war the British appointed him 
as the Director-General of the newly constituted Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research (CSIR). From then on he functioned as a 
scientific administrator. It was in this capacity that Nehru come to know 
him. 

Dr Bhatnagar was a restless person bubbling with nervous energy. 
Endowed with considerable organizing ability, he had great capacity to 
get industrialists interested in the work he was doing and in raising 
substantial donations to start new laboratories. He was primarily res- 
ponsible for establishing a China of important national laboratories and 
institutes such as physical, chemical, electro-chemical, metallurgical, 
building research, road research, leather research, salt research, food 
research, drug research, and innumerable others. 

Dr Bhatnagar disliked ICS officials so much that hepresuaded him- 
self that the original devil was an ICS man. He asked for and received 
the status and emoluments of an ICS Secretary to the Government of 
India. In fact he become Secretary in two successive Ministries in addi- 
tion to his own charge as Director-General, CSIR. The two senior 
ICS Officers Dr Bhatnagar could not stand the sight of were S.A. 
Venkataraman and H.M. Patel. Sometimes Dr Bhatnagar carried his 
vendetta against the ICS too far. More than once I had to caution him 
against carrying flippant tales to the Prime Minister against individual 
ICS men. 

Suavity was not one of Dr Bhatnagar’s many virtues. Ha used to 
irritate the Prime Minister fartoooften. But he was an honest man who 
fearlessly spoke to the PM. It was when he needlessly strayed into 



The Scientific Trie 


93 


regions beyond his sphere of activity that he became insufferable. But 
he meant well. 

Early in 1952 a young man by the name of M. Santappa came to 
see me in Delhi on his way to Andhra Pradesh from England. After 
graduating from Madras University and undergoing the M.Sc. course 
at the Banares Hindu University, he went to England in 1947 for fur- 
ther studies. In 1948 he took a diploma in Plastic technology from the 
City and Guilds Institute, London. In 1949 he took the Ph. D in Org- 
anic Chemistry in London. In 1951 he took the Ph. D. in Physical 
Chemistry in Manchester. I w'as impressed by the young man with the 
double Ph. D. My admiration for him grew when I learn ’t that he was 
a Harijan. 

I spoke to Dr Bhatnagar and asked him if the CSIR could profi- 
table utilize the services of Dr Santappa. When Dr Santappa met Dr 
Bhatnagar subsequently-, he offered him a post which Dr Santappa con- 
sidered a routine one. He declined to accept it and went home. Later, 
when I met Dr Bhatnagar, I asked him why he let Dr Santappa go away. 
He told me-that he did not get the impression that I was keen about 
Dr Santappa; I was annoyed and told him that his attitude was all 
wrong; that he should employ an individual not because a third person 
was keen but solely because of his worth; and that I disliked recom- 
mending people and would only bring worth-while people to the notice 
of those concerned. Here was a Harijan with a brilliant record and it 
should have occurred to you that you should go out of your way to re- 
coginse his merit and make use of his service.” Dr Bhatnagar further 
annoyed me by saying that he would write to Dr Santappa offering him 
a better position. I told him “don’t, if you do anything of the kind I 
shall ask Dr Santappa to reject it with contempt. He is a bright young 
man and I have no doubt Lat he will find his level without your help.” 

Soon after I shifted to Madras in November 1977, I came across 
Dr Santappa by chance. I was happy to learn that since 1973 he has 
been Director, Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI), Madras, a 
premier scientific Institute of CSIR, and Honorary Professor of Physi- 
cal; Chemistry, University of Madras. 

(He joined ■ he 'Mddras- University in 1952 as Reader and Head of 
the Departme 1 6f Physical Ghernistry.'From 1958-65 he was University 
Professor of Physical Chemsitry; and in 1966 hewas promoted to Senior 
Professor and Head of the Department of Physical Chemistry, Univer- 
sity of Madras. He has Veen -guiding research at the doctoral level for 
many 3 'ears. So far 35 scientists under his training have obtained Ph. D 
degrees and 12 are now under training. 

Apart from research contributions on various aspects of chemistry. 



94 


My Days with Nehru 


Dr Santappa has published scientific papers in over 200 journals of 
international reputation and standing. His research results now from 
part of standard books on these subjects. He has won numerous 
academic awards and honours and fellowships of distinguished bodies. 

He had been actively connected with seven universities as member 
of senates and syndicates; with the University Grants Commission as 
amember; several Boards, Boards of Studies, Planning Committees and 
Boards of Education under the Union Ministry of Education and Social 
Welfare and the Department of Science and Technology, Government 
of India; as Member and many other government bodies connected 
with all aspects of leather and livestock as chairman, director or 
member. 

As Director of CLRI for the past five years, Dr Santappa has acqiur- 
ed considerable administrative experience. Having been born in 1923, 
he is now past 55. 1 do hope that the Government of India will continue 
to make use of his services as long as he is physically fit. A government 
committed to special treatment to Harijans and other weaker sections 
of the population should seek out distinguished people like Dr 
Santappa and place them in appropriate positions. Government should 
not take cover under the false plea that suitable men are not available 
among the Harijans. Government should honestly follow the injunction 
with the built-in promise: “Seek, and Ye Shall Find.” 

Dr Santappa took over his new appointment as Vice-Chancellor of 
the Sri Venkateswara University in Andhra Pradesh on 1,7 January 
1979. I hope this is not the end for him. I also hope he will keep up 
his research work. 

Dr Bhatnagar was a man who did not have much attachment to 
money. Much of the royalties he received on his books and from earlier 
research were gifted by him to government to provide awards to crea- 
tive scientists. 

F.C. Mahalanobis 

He was a regular member of the Indian Educational Service (lES) 
which the ICS considered as “inferior.” Mahalanobis knew the art of 
cultivating the right people. He came into contact with Nehru in the 
National Planning Committee constituted by the Indian National Con- 
gress at Nehru’s instance during the Presidentship of Subhas Chandra 
Bose in 1938. Ever since then he stuck to Nehru. By 1938 Mahalanobis 
had registered the Indian Statistical Institute Society and started opera- 
tions in a modest way. 

Early in 1946, soon after I joined Nehru in Allahabad, Mahalanobis

took under his wings a young man, Pitambar Pant, who had done sec- 
retarial work for Nehru for about three months. He was given some 
training at the Indi&amp;n Statistical Institute in Calcutta and later at New 
York for further training. For Mahalanobis, Pitambar Pant was an in- 
vestment inasmuch as he (Nehru) was concerned. In subsequent years 
Mahalanobis and Pant developed a relaiionship of scratching each 
other’s back and singing each other’s praise to Nehru. Before Nebru, 
Mahalanobis invested Pant with qualities he did not possess. This 
relationship was used effectively by Mahalanobis to create the impres- 
sion among others that he was very close to Nehru. Incidentally, 
Mahalanobis was not the only person who indulged in this practice. 

It was since Independence that Mahalanobis and the Indian Statis- 
tical Institute prospered spectacularly. Without any difficulty the Indian 
Statistical Institute received all the money it asked for. Finance Minis- 
ter C.D. Deshmukh, in particular, was over-indulgent to Mahalanobis 
and his Institute and protected them from attacks by civil servants. He 
turned Nelson’s eye to allegations of irregularities. 

Soon after the Dominion government came into existence in 1947 
Mahalanobis became a man of consequence in the capital, two senior 
Bengali ICS officers spread the rumour that Mahalanobis was caught 
in corruption, while in service, by the British and that he escaped by 
the skin of his teeth with minor punishment. I must frankly admit 
that Bengalis are as good as Malayalis at gunning for each other. 

After Pitambar Pant returned from New York, Mahalanobis sugg- 
ested that he might be given a suitable appointment in the government 
and asked to deal with the statistical aspect of refugee relief and rehabi- 
litation, There was difficulty in absorbing Pant in a regular government 
post; so he was appointed as Private Secretary to the Minister of State 
for Relief and Rehabilitation. 

It was on the recommendations contained in a detailed paper pre- 
pared by Pitamber Pant that the union cabinet decided to abolish the 
cumbersome British practice by introducing the decimal system in cur- 
rency and coinage and the metric system in weights and measures. 

In the meantime Mahalanobis gothimself appointed as the Honorary 
Statistical Adviser to the Cabinet. For some time Mahalanobis had 
been trying to get an official house allotted to him in New Delhi. His 
unpopularity with the bureaucracy was that they successfully put obst- 
acles in his way in spite of the Prime Minister speaking to the Minister 
for Works and Housing. At last Mahalanobis discovered that the two- 
storeyed house in King Georges avenue vacated by K.P.S. Menon on 
his appointment as Ambassador in Moscow remained unoccupied. He 
approached the Estate office and was promptly told that it had been 



96 


My Days with Nehru 


allotted to N.R. Pillai.-the. new Secretary-General of the External 
Affairs Ministry, In his desperation Mahalanobis again went to Nehru 
with his tale of woe. Nehru called me and said in angry tones in the 
presence of Mahalanobis that he had been trying to get a house allotted 
to Mahalanobis for months and nothing had happend. He asked me to 
find out if something could be done quickly. I rang up the Secretary of 
the Works and Housing Ministry and asked him to give me a list of 
four-bed-roomed houses, lying vacant in New Delhi. I told him that 
one such was urgently needed for a person who had the status of a 
Minister of State. Later in the day he rang back to say that there was- 
only one which was vacant and that it w'as a good one with extensive 
grounds. Had he known that the person I wanted help was Mahalanobis, 
there would have been no vacant house. I asked him to allot the vacant 
house to N.R. Pillai and cancel his other allotment in King Georges 
Avenue which should be allotted to Mahalanobis. He issued immediate 
orders accordingly to the Estate Office. In the mean time I persuaded 
N.R. Pillai to accept the new allotment which was actually a better one. 
Pillai, who is a very fair minded person, told me that normally he would 
never go out of his way to help Mahalanobis. I informed Mahalanobis 
about the allotment and asked him to let me know if any hitch develop- 
ed. Mahalanobis had the house reallotted to the Indian Statistical Insti- 
tute Society so that he did not have to pay rent personally. Three days 
later Mahalanobis, accompanied byPitambar Pant, came to thank me. 
As he was about to leave he said “you and I should work together.” 
This annoyed me. I told him “I love to do that, but the trouble is that 
I have in my plate more than what I can manage.” 

Pitambar Pant was selected to IAS by the U.P.S.C. in the Home 
Ministry’s recruitment of over-age candidates. After Mahalanobis was 
appointed as de facto Member of the Planning Commission, Pant was 
taken into the Persepective Planning Division directly under the charge 
of Mahalanobis. Pant thrived there and, under the Indira regime, .was - 
pitch-forked as a Member of the Planning Commission from the level 
of a junior Joint Secretary. As he had to resign from the IAS to be a 
Member of the Planning Commission, he extracted an undertaking 
from the government that in case he ceased to be a member, he would be 
provided with a government job commensurate with his seniority in the 
IAS until he reached the retirement age of 58 and that his pension and 
other retirement benefits would be protected. When C. Subramaniam 
became Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, he had no use 
for Pant who, in the absence of Mahalanobis from the scene, was 
hunted out to the Department of Science and Technology and put in 
charge of “Environment,” Pant was a firm believer in astrology. An 



The Scientific Trie 


97 


astrologer had told him that he would not live beyond the age of 50. 
Most astrological predictions of an unfavourable nature tend to come 
true; and the one about Pant proved to be on exception. 

Indian Statistical Institute which Mahalanobis built upas an orgam'- 
zation of considerable size and international reputation was owned by 
a society in which none but Mahalanobis counted. All others were rub- 
ber stamps for him. For a number of years after retirement K.P.S. 
Menon, in spite of advice from some of his friends and well-wishers, 
allowed himself to be installed as chairman of the society and to be a 
decorative rubber stamp. The society received large annual mainten- 
ance grants from the Government of India and generous fees for speci- 
fic work the Institute carried out for the government. In addition the 
society received directly from the Ford Foundation substantial grants 
in rupees and in dollars to be spent at the discretion of Mahalanobis. 
It was from the Ford Foundation grants that Mahalanobis paid for the 
travelling and other expenses of his wife whom he took with him on 
all his foreign and internal travels. 

The house in Barrackpore belonging to Mrs Mahalanobis was taken 
by the Indian Statistical Institute Society on a generous rental for the 
residence of Mahalanobis. The society spent a substantial amount for 
the extensive repairs, renovations and additions to the house in addi- 
tion to payment of rental to Mrs Mahalanobis. The Indian Statistical 
Institute also paid Mahalanobis a salary of Rs 3,000 per month. In 
addition Mahalanobis received his pension from government for his 
services in the lES. After the death of Mahalanobis his residence, was 
converted into the library of the Indian Statistical Institute and rent 
continues to be paid to Mrs Mahalanobis who also enjoys free quarters 
there. 

The ISI Society, at the instance of Mahalanobis, leased about 250 
acres of land in Giridhi (Bihar) belonging to his close relatives with- 
out executing proper formal agreement. Large sums were spent by the 
society on developing the property. The relatives are now demanding 
either the return of the land or the price at current market rate having 
no regard to the lager sums already spent by the society on develop- 
ment. 

One need not make heavy weather of these cases of elasticity in fin- 
■ ancial matters considering the significant contributions made by Maha- 
lanobis to the cause of statistical science in India. He built up a first- 
rate institution in India, trained a large number of first-class men in 
this field and put India in the forefront of nations in the realm'of 
statistics. The National Sample Survey is an innovation introduced and 
built up by Mahalanobis even though it is now a fullfledged govern- 



98 


My Days with Nehru 


ment organization with no administrative connection with the ISI. 

None in India has questioned the eminence of Mahalanobis in the 
field of statistics. His eminence is recognised internationally. But many 
in the Planning Commission and other organs of the Government of 
India did not believe that Mahalanobis possessed the scientific detach- 
ment so necessary for the correct interpretation of statistics. It was be- 
cause of this that some called Mahalanobis “Mahabaloney.” Maha- 
lanobis had definite ideological predilections undesirable in a genuine 
scientist.. 

Opinions might vary about the contribution of Mahalanobis to Plan- 
ning. When one wishes to build a noble edifice one does not look for a 
carpenter first; one sends for an architect. It is the architect’s job to 
employ good carpenters. In the planning process Mahalanobis was by 
no means an architect. 

Dr H.J. Bhabha 

Much before Nehru entered government he had known Homi Bhabha 
as a young scientist working at the Tata Institute of Fundamental 
Research. Bhabha had diverse interests. He was a painter and a 
connoisseur of music and Indian classical dancing. 

Bhabha turned his attention to nuclear science at the earliest opport- 
unity. With the advent of the national government Bhabha received 
from Nehru all the encouragement he needed. The Department of 
Atomic Energy and the Atomic Energy Commission were created, 
Bhabha was named the Secretary of the Department and the Chairman 
of the Commission with the status and emoluments higher than those 
of a Secretary to the Government of India but Bhabha did not take 
advantage of the enhanced salary. He preferred to draw a lower 
salary. ^ 

When the activities of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research 
got expanded requiring substantially more funds which the Tatas could 
not afford to spend, government decided to take- over the institution. 
Dr Bhatnagar made government take-over conditional on dropping 
“TATA” from the name of the Institute. Dr Bhabha, who grew up 
- with the Institute, fought a battle royal and ultimately Nehru upheld 
Bhabha’s stand. 

Bhabha had vision and foresight and capacity to think big. He clear- 
ly foresaw before any one else the importance of developing nuclear 
energy for India. With the full ba^cking of Nehru, Bhabha proceeded 
with the work with zeal and determination and produced a fine organi- 
zation with dedicated people in the process.

In 1957 1 asked Dr Bhabha how soon the Atomic Energy Commis- 
sion could produce an atomic bomb if the government gave the green 
signal. He replied “three years for the atom bomb and five years for the 
hydrogen bomb.” He added “I hope India will never make the bomb 
because it is an instrument of terror and mass destruction and that in 
any event, since several nations have it, for India the military value is 
doubtful. It can only create in us Big Power chauvinism.” He said he 
was not particularly worried about the cost involved. His mind was full 
of peaceful uses of nuclear energy — known and some yet tmkown — for 
diverse needs. 

Dr Bhabha was unanimously elected as the Chairman of the Inter- 
national Conference on peaceful uses of nuclear energy at Geneva. 

A cruel fate cut short an illustrious life and deprived India of the 
services of a dedicated and remarkable man. He died in an air crash 
over Mont Blanc in the Alps. 



15 How oily u-aj Oil 


In the chapter “Two Weather-Beaten Ministers” in my first book, 
I had mentioned about the unorthodox appointment of K.K. Salmi 
early in 1956 in the Government of India to deal with all aspects of 
oil. Sahni contributed not only to a reduction in the petroleum product 
prices, which was mopped up by the government and not passed on 
to the consumer, but was closely associated with the formulation of 
government’s subsequent oil policy. It was at my instance that Salmi 
resigned from Burmah Shell in 1956 at considerable personal sacrifice, 
and Nehru took the initiative in dealing with the Chairman of the 
Union Public Service Commission to induct him into the government. 
Nehru took keen interest on Sahni’s work until he left the government 
at the end of 1961. 

In view of the' importance of petroleum in both peace and war, the 
government by the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 decided to 
develop a viable petroleum industry under state control. It was, how- 
ever, made clear that the state did not propose to take over existing 
units in the private sector but their future development would be under 
state control. Even so the first major phase of development of indi- 
genous refining capacity in the post- 1948 period was left in fact to the 
private sector. The three refineries, ' two at Bombay and one at 
Visakhapatnam came on stream between 19:4 and 1957. 

The initial reluctance of Foreign Oil companies to establish refin- 
eries in India underwent a change in 1951 when Anglo-lranian Oil 
Company in Iran was nationalized and there was disruption of supplies. 
India obtained 70 per cent of her requirements from Iran. As this 
source of supply, was no longer available, the oil companies were in- 
curring higher transport cost on petroleum products and they were, 
therefore, more inclined to diversify the location of their refineries and 
build them in importing countries like India. 

The Ministry of Natural Resources under K.D. Malavi\a also 
allowed Foreign Private Investment in the field of oil exploration. The 
government entered into an agreement with the Standard Vacuum Oil 
Company in 1954— government holding 25 per cent and Standard 
Vacuum 75 per cent, for exploration activities covering a concession 
area of 10,000 square miles in West Bengal. This agreement granted 



How oily Oil 


101 


majority equity share and complete control of management to Stand- 
ard Vacuum and if losses were incurred Standard Vacuum could 
deduct its share from its marketing income for income-tax purposes. 

Standard Vacuum drilled 10 unsuccessful wells before abandoning 
the project in 1961. The Government of India lost Rs 18.4 million 
plus loss of income-tax due to the deduction from its marketing income 
of Standard Vacuum’s share of losses. 

As a result of the aforesaid agreements during the period 1948, as 
many as 55 foreign oil companies operating in India controlled oil ex- 
ploration, oil refining, imports and distribution of petroleum products. 
The government’s agreement to the setting up of completely foreign 
owned refineries and exploration and its commitment of total non-in- 
terferance with the working of these concerns were in sharp conflict 
with the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 under which the 
petroleum industry was to be developed in the state sector. Perhaps 
this attitude was dictated by the highly capital intensive and skilled 
nature of petroleum industry and considered foreign private investment 
was in the national interest. 

Because of its total ignorance about the working and ramifications 
of oil industry, the government did not fully appreciate the consequ- 
ences of the terms on which it had agreed to invite foreign private 
capital into oil industry. Gradually thereafter it began to be worried 
about the effect on the country’s balance of payment by allowing 
foreign companies to hold all the equity, and the dividend remittances 
were imposing an additional burden, 

Sahni had been on a fact-finding-cum-study-trip to Europe and 
America and he came back convinced that the government could and 
should enter the oil industry covering all facets and by early 1956 the 
government’s attitude began to change and this was reflected in the 
New Industrial Policy Resolution adopted in 1956. The resolution 
classified oil in the first category whose future development would be 
the exclusive responsibility of the state. 

The period after the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 was 
' characterized by two developments; 

(1) Foreign Private Investment bad to relinquish complete control 
and ownership and accept minority or equal equity interest in 
joint ventures with the government. The- government’s role in oil 
exploration and production, refining, imports and distribution of 
petroleum products increased progressively. 

(2) Secondly the independence of the foreign oil companies in 



102 


My ' Days with Nehru 

pursuing their own pricing"policies was curtailed by stale inter- 
vention. 

The Oil Industry in a report submitted in 1952 to the government 
had said that there would be an annual loss to the companies of Rs 20 
million if crude oil were to be refined in India. Therefore, in its 
anxiety to get the oil companies to set up refineries and exploration 
programmes in India, the Government of India, in utter folly, literally 
conceded whatever terms were asked for. 

Sahni was able to demonstrate to the government the unfavourable 
clauses in the agreements covering refinery and exploration. He 
obtained a copy of M.V. Kellogs and Company’s feasibility study for 
a refinery in Latin America, which clearly revealed that payout for a 
refinery on the basis of import parity price is less than two years and 
therefore there was no need to give concessions some of which are 
mentioned. 

By allowing the oil refineries to import crude oil from the source 
of their choice, India had surrendered whatever margin of manoeuvr- 
ability which otherwise she might have had in buying crude oil at 
competitive prices. The crude supply clause caused considerable 
strain on India’s balance of payment during the period 1958-69 when 
the prices paid for crude oil were higher than those prevailing in the 
world market. An official of the World Bank has estimated the excess 
cost to India of crude oil imported was about $ 75 million during the 
aforesaid period as India was denied the benefit of prevalent discounts. 

Further, the refinery agreements allowed the companies to price 
their domestically refined products at levels higher than those at 
which the same products vvould otherwise have been imported. Un- 
fortunately the Government of India was not fully versed in the in- 
tricacies of the cost elements which enter into pricing and additionally 
gave oil companies the benefit of duty protection for oil production 
in India for a period of ten years from the commencement of full 
scale refinery operation or until 31 December 1965, which ever was 
earlier and the difference between the customs duty and excise duty 
thus benefited the oil companies as a duty protection for their refine- 
ries in India. 

The oil companies were aware of the cabinet’s unhappiness over the 
refinery agreements and under indirect pressure from the government, 
and in their enlightened self-interest gave up duty protection in stages 
starting from 1 October 1956 through January 1959, and the govern- 
ment was thus able to save about Rs 70 crores against the total 
benefit of Rs 85 crores which would have accrued to the three oil

companies. The oil companies did not agree to refund the duty pro- 
tection which they had already enjoyed. It is relevant to mention that 
the cost of the three refineries was actually below Rs 50 crores 
whereas the companies were given duty protection alone of Rs 85 
crores. 

Remittance clause was another unfavourable one. When Sahni 
approached in 1956 the Ministry of Finance/Reserve Bank of India for 
details of remittances by oil companies, detailed figures were not 
available as figures were inclusive of vegetable oil and other non- 
mineral oils and as the remittances in India did not give a correct 
picture of currency liability they had to be adjusted on the basis of 
data supplied by the Bank of England. However, this procedure was 
revised to provide details of remittances covering all phases of 
petroleum including dividend, salaries, expenses on overseas estabh'sh- 
ments etc. 

In any appraisal of the refinery agreements, the main point to be 
considered is their timing in assessing these agreements — it must be 
asked if India could have secured any better terms from these com- 
panies at the time. As for the refinery Agreements of early fifties the 
oil companies dominated the world petroleum industry and the Indian 
government knew little about the oil industry. What is really imcom- 
prehensiable and inexcusable are the refinery agreements with Phillips 
Petroleum Company at Cochin, National Iranian Oil Company at 
Madras and with a French Company at Haldiya. 

As for the Cochin Refinery deal, Phillips Petroleum and Duncan 
Brothers had submitted a proposal to the Petroleum Ministry when 
Sahni was Joint Secretary. It was examined and the proposal was 
turned down with the approval of the Prime Minister much to the dis- 
appointment of the Minister of State K.D. Malaviya. However, the 
proposal was cleared by the government on terms, which were even 
more unfavourable to the government, than the initial proposal with- 
in a year of the exit of Sahni from the ministry at the end of 1961. It 
is odd that Malaviya, who had by that time become Cabinet Minister, 
S.S. Khera, Secretary Petroleum had become Cabinet Secretary and 
K.R. Damle, Petroleum Secretary who was earlier Chairman of the 
first Price Enquiry Committee — all of whom should have known better, 
should have approved of the subsequent proposal. Those who believe 
there must have been considerations other than the national interest 
in this melancholy transaction cannot be blamed. 

Phillips Petroleum Company w'as guaranteed a process margin of 
$ 1.35 per barrel for a period of ten years from 1969 and § 1.30 per 
barrel for the next five years. These figures took into account a delivery 



104 


My Days with Nehru 

cost of imported crude of $ 1.94 per barrel and the tJien current ex- 
refinery prices based on import parity. It should be noted that the terms 
of the Cochin Refinery agreement were even worse than the terms of 
agreements made in the fifties. The margin allowed was very high 
compared with that. of the foreign refineries in India. As compared 
with the process margin of S 1.35 per barrel allowed to Phillips 
Petroleum, the process margins at Burmah Shell, ESSO and Caltex- 
refineries were $ 1.24 per barrel, $ 1.02 per barrel and 5 0.97 per 
barrel respectively; The excess amount paid relates to the refining 
capacity of 2.5 million tons per annum or 17,500,000 barrels per 
annum. Readers can calculate the loss to India in this indefensible 
transaction. 

For its minority shareholding Phillips Petroleum were appointed 
agents for Cochin Refinery with the right to arrange for supplies of 
imported crude and transport of the crude and the construction work 
for the Cochin Refinery on a turn key basis. Phillips Petroleum were 
to provide technical services to the refinery for which they were to 
receive in foreign exchange J 5.65 million and a further Rs. 23.60 
million in India. 

A well informed person, once connected with the Petroleum Indus- 
try, pointed out in giving evidence before the Estimates Committee: 
“This margin is not obtainable by them even in their own country or 
by any refinery anywhere in the world.” 

Lok Sabha Estimates Committee (1967-8) in their 50th report, 
Petroleum and Petroleum Products page 130-2 has stressed that: 
“The government have not been vigilant enough in weighing the 
advantages and disadvantages of the various clauses in this agreement 
and the technical fees payable to the foreign collaborators in the 
Cochin Refinery was unduly high and was causing a strain on balance 
of payment.” 

The Secretary of the Petroleum Ministry told the Estimates Com- 
mittee; “It is really a foreign exchange benefit. Phillips help to bring 
to us three to four million dollars of foreign exchange. Besides they 
help by bringing $ 19 to 20 million ofloan for financing the refinery.” 

It is indeed ironic that the Secretary of the Ministry should have 
made this statement because ENI credit $ 100 million which w'as con- 
cluded by Sahni earlier, was available to the Indian government for 
setting up 100 per cent public owned refineries. Technical know-how 
was readily available from consultants, contractors and builders of re- 
fineries who not only set up the plant but also arranged for start up 
and to train Indians to take over the unit. Glut of crude oil had 
developed in. the world crude oil market and alternative sources of 



How oily was Oil 


105 


crude oil supplies from the independents and state oil companies had 
emerged. 

The excessive process margin guaranteed to Phillips was criticized 
in Parliament; and in 1969 government succeeded in modifying the 
agreement but the modifications still provided Phillips Petroleum a 10 
per cent annual return on its shareholding in dollars which will give a 
net after-tax dividend to Phillips of not less than the rupee equivalent 
of 5 388,270.24. If in any particular year this average net dividend is 
not achieved the government is to make up to the requisite extent. 

The 1969 modifications contains extraordinary incentives and con- 
cessions to Phillips in guaranteeing a 10 per cent return on its share- 
holding in dollars regardless of any increase in processing cost, free 
of income tax, variations in the dollar/rupee exchange rate or varia- 
tions in the ex-refinery prices. 

According to the Department of Justice US government, a Federal 
Grand Jury at Tulsa, USA on 2 September 1976 indicted the Phillips 
Petroleum Company as well as its present President and Chief Execu- 
tive Officer and two former Presidents and Chief Executive Officers on 
charges of conspiracy to defraud (he United States by impeding the 
Internal Revenue Services in determining and collecting taxes of the 
corporation. The indictment charged that substantial sums of money 
amounting to approximately § three million were generated by confi- 
dential transactions and concealed as deposits in Swiss bank accounts. 

The Company had also received technical services fee of $ 440,000 
per annum from Cochin Refinery Limited which were transmitted to 
the Panama subsidiary, where they were available for confidential dis- 
bursements to certain foreign entities. 

Specifically the indictment charged that funds from Swiss accounts 
and the technical service fee transmitted to the Panama subsidiary 
were both used to make concealed and confidential disbursements to 
certain foreign entities, who assisted in obtaining the Cochin Refinery 
contract. 

The indictment charged all the defendants and it carries a maximum 
penalty on conviction of a § 10,000 fine for the corporation and a 
$ 10,000 fine and five years in prison for an individual. 

The judgement of the Federal Grand Jury reveals how slush funds 
were built up in Switzerland and Panama to the tune of around nine 
million dollars and utilized for under-the-counter payments to Indians, 
and the comments of the Estimates Committee raise a vital issue as to 
who were responsible for such an agreement. It is no use blaming the 
multi-national oil companies as they are not here for our health but to 
make profits, and it is for the Government of India itself to protect its 



106 


My Days with Nehru 

interests. The names of the indicted could be obtained by the Indian 
government from the Justice Department in Washington and the 
government should hold an enquiry into the conduct of the people 
concerned both at the official and political level. 

As for Madras Refinery, the government again committed the 
mistake of tying up the supply of crude at a price which has turned 
out to be very unfavourable for the country. They obtained sour 
Darius crude which had a high sulpher content and at the time there 
were no buyers for it. This was based on the advice of a foreign oil ex- 
pert whom the ministry had engaged, and this prevented a very sub- 
stantial downward adjustment in the price of crude oil when substan- 
tial discounts were offered on posted prices. The Government of India 
asked the National Iranian Oil Company to reduce its price but the 
company refused. ■&gt; 

As for Haldiya there was no justification in setting it up. The 
capacity of Barauni Refinery could have been increased and the 
government could have made full use of the product pipeline which 
they had laid from Barauni to Calcutta. When Haldiya refinery comes 
on stream what purpose will the product pipeline serve— except that 
about Rs 50 crores will be written off? A commission was appointed 
to examine the working of the pipeline and its alignment but no action 
has been taken on the commission’s report submitted to the govern- 
ment some three years back. 

The setting up of refinery at Haldiya and a second refinery in Assam 
are typical examples where the petroleum ministers have used their 
good offices to set up refineries in their respective states even though 
there were no economic and/or technical justification for its construc- 
tion. 

The government is setting up a further refinery at Mathura and the 
pipeline is being laid from Salaya to Mathura and also a spur taken 
to the Koyali refinery. The government and Indian Oil Corporation 
were fully aware of the Bombay High oil prospects and it would have 
been cheaper and saved the country hundreds of crores of rupees by 
expanding the capacities of the two existing refineries in Bombay, 
which by then had become 100 per cent government-owned and also 
its own Koyali refinery. To take the Bombay High crude oil in tankers 
to Salaya and then to pump it through the pipeline to Mathura and 
Koyali can never be an economic proposition. The danger, which is 
real, to the Taj Mahal could also have been averted. 

Sahni’s study tour in early 1956 gave him a much needed opportu- 
nity to build up contacts with well known oil-world personalities parti- 
cularly men connected with public sector organizations. Sahni met 



How oily was Oil 


107 


Mr Enrico Mattei, President of ENI; Monsieur Blancart, Director 
General of Petroleum in Paris who later became Minister of Aviation 
in General De Gaulle’s government; Mr Bermudes, Director General, 
Pemex, Mexico and Mr Gurmar Myrdal, Secretary General of United 
Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva. 

Mattei helped in building the crude pipeline from Naharkatiya to 
Barauni at a very competitive rate and also provided a line of credit 
of S 100 million for public sector projects for oil covering exploration, 
refining, lubricating plants, petro-chemical units, pipelines etc. It is 
indeed regretable that this credit was not used fully. Instead a refinery 
at Cochin and lubricant manufacturing and blending units at Bombay 
and Calcutta were set up in collaboration with private sector oil 
companies — such are the ways of working of our socialist ministers 
and the secretaries of “strong” views about Public Sector. 

Monsieur Blancart and Monsieur Navare, President of Institute 
France De Petroleum assisted in setting up an Indian Petroleum Institute 
— here again our institute has very little to show as for training of 
personnel and research, whereas the Institute France De Petrole has 
done magnificent work in these respects. 

Bermudes gave a very clear picture of his company from pre-nation- 
alization days and post nationalization period. A senior Secretary of 
the Indian Government Dr S.S. Bhatnagar, who visited Mexico in 
1954 had reported that the oil industry was nationalized in Mexico in 
1946 and its production of crude oil in 1954 was one-thirtieth of its 
production prior to the expropriation, whereas Sahni’s report mention- 
ed Pemex had produced 30 million tons in 1 955 which was the highest 
level recorded since 1926 when the industry, which was expropriated 
in 1938, was in the hands of foreign companies, and they were produc- 
ing crude at the maximum level. I recalled Dr Bhatnagar’s report, so 
Sahni was asked to recheck his figures. Pemex Officials confirmed to 
our ambassador in Mexico that the figures quoted by Sahni were 
correct. The earlier report of Dr Bhatnagar really baffled both Nehru 
and me. Perhaps he did not approve of nationalization of oil. 

Gunnar Myrdal and his colleagues spoke about their findings and 
gave Sahni a copy of their report “price of oil in Western Europe.” 
The conclusions drawn in this report had given rise to a number of 
difficulties and complex issues, some of them of a very controversial 
nature. The report was subsequently withdrawn by the United Nations 
Secretariat. Nevertheless it had the desired salutary effect in reducing 
petroleum product prices in Europe. 

Sahni’s report indicated that the faults in the government were 
basically due to a deeply entrenched system of diversified control on

Upto 1949, prices were based oa Gulf of Mexico plus ocean freight 
to India. After the publication of the ECC’s report (price of oil in 
western Europe) the FOB price of Gulf of Mexico was transplanted 
at Abadan. Prior to the VSA procedure the oil companies’ marketing 
charges and profit came out of the CIF price and there was no addi- 
tional charge. Under the VSA the oil companies were assured of a 
fixed margin of 10 per cent on CIF cost and also post CIF cost— as 
a result the oil companies had no incentive to economise. 

It is instructive to compare the behaviour of the oil companies’ 
unit costs of marketing and distribution from 1951/56 (the VSA 
period) and 1958/63 (the post VSA period). These reveal that upto 
1957 an increasing volume of sales was accompanied by increasing 
unit cost of marketing and distribution but that the reverse was the 
case from 1958 to 1963. It is obvious that during the VSA period the 
companies showed no concern about economy in cost. Increase in the 
companies’ unit cost took place at a time of overall stable prices as 
judged by the general wholesale price index which (with the 1952/53 
as a base year) was 125 in 1951 but fell to 102.7 by 1956. But as 
against the fall of 22.3 per cent in'the price index during 1951-1956; 
the unit cost of the foreign oil companies rose by 39 per cent. Conver- 
sely during 1958-63 when the general wholesale price index rose by 
about 21.5 per cent the unit cost of foreign oil marketing companies 
fell by 23 per cent. 

Sahni recommended a price reduction of about Rs 20 crores on 
the then sales of around five million tons in the country. A Chief Cost 
Accounts OfiScer was appointed, and under Sahni’s direction, he 
arrived at an average annual reduction of Rs 195.35 million in the 
gross profit of the oil companies. The oil companies naturally objected 
to it and under pressure from the Ministry of Finance, the adhoc 
reduction was fixed at Rs 120 million per year. Sahni was not satis- 
fied and an Oil Price Enquiry Committee was appointed in 1959 
under the Chairmanship of K.R. Damle. 

The Damle Committee found that there was further scope of lower- 
ing the prices of the products sold in India and found that the import 
cost of products given by the companies did not take into account 
the discounts, that were available internationally. Unfortunately the 
committee also recommended a profit of 12 per cent on capital 
employed. The saving which would result from the committee s 
recommendation were estimated at Rs 137.8 million per annum. ^ 

Sahni expressed dis-satisfaction which the Damle Committee’s 
report as the end result was only marginally above the adhoc figure 
fixed by the Finance Ministry. Sahni refused to recommend the

acceptance by the ministry of this report — which did not go down 
well with the steel frame at the centre. 

By 1955 imports of crude oil and deficit petroleum products were 
costing Rs 845 million annually and with the ever increasing demand 
for petroleum products India’s balance of payment position began to 
deteriorate sharp’y. The government therefore had to consider ways 
of reducing foreign exchange expenditure on imports. In accordance 
with Sahni’s suggestions, the government began to implement the 
following alternative ways to reduce foreign exchange expenditure; 

To find oil in India so as to replace imported Oil: In accordance 
with the government’s policy it was decided to entrust further oil ex- 
ploration to a government agency. With the assistance of the USSR 
government by way of credit and technical assistance a petroleum 
cell in the Geological Survey of India was set up in 1955 which sub- 
sequently became a Directorate and in 1959 an Independent Statu- 
tory Commission. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission was made 
responsible for oil exploration throughout the country in areas other 
than those leased to Oil India Limited and Assam Oil Company. 

The first major find of the commission was the Cambay gas field 
which was followed by the discovery of the Ankleshwar oil field. 
Other significant discoveries reported by the ONGC include fields at 
Kalol, Lakwa and Sibsagar. 

The ONGC have met with success in offshore exploration which 
was imdertaken on an ownership-contract basis with a US company 
by purchase of a platform from Japan. Substantial reserves have been 
established and the Bombay High field is capable of supplying 12 
million tons of oil per year. Competent experts are of the view that 
it is unfortunate that the Planning Commission has restricted the 
ONGC to extract only nine million tons of oil per year from 1981-82 
onwards from Bombay High. These experts even say that the reserves 
can steadily sustain, in accordance with established extraction prac- 
tises, production of 14-15 million tons per annum. 

In order to conserve the dwindling foreign exchange reserves, the 
government during 1959 invited parties to assist in oil exploration in 
the country. It published its plans for oil exploration in the country 
and invited parties to participate in exploration on mutually accepta- 
ble terms. 

Burmah Oil Company, applied for further concession area in 
Assam. As a result a supplementary agreement was concluded in 1961. 
Oil India was entrusted with an additional 1800 square miles of area 
for exploration and Burmah Oil agreed to the government’s equity 
share in Oil India to be raised from 33.1/3 per cent to 50 per cent.

My Days with Nehrti 


During the negotiations an impasse was reached in respect of 
crude availability to Assam Oil Company at reduced price and the 
quantum of return on their investment. Sahni further demanded a 
bonus payment from Oil India to the governmant for the concession 
in a promising area. Burmah Oil negotiator went to the UK for con- 
sultations and returned within a few days of Sahni proceeding on 
leave towards the end of May 1961. Khera took over the negotiations 
and an accord was reached. The government agreed to a price for 
crude supplied to Assam Oil Company which was one-fifth of the 
price charged to the public sector refineries — between 1960-70 the 
average price charged to Assam Oil Company was Rs 17.6 as against 
Rs 105.32 for public sector refineries. Further the crude oil produced 
by Oil India was to be priced in such a way that a minimum return 
(after payment of all taxes including tax payment on dividend) at 
between nine and 13 per cent per annum on the paid up share capital 


was guaranteed from 1962 onwards irrespective of the offtake of crude 
by the Indian government refineries and without providing an import 
parity price as ceiling. During negotiations Burmah Oil had indicated 
a price of Rs 48 per ton for crude oil delivered at Barauni but after 
Sahni’s absence on leave they charged the Indian refineries as much 
as Rs 126.44 per ton in 1962. Thus the government had to make 
compensatory payments to oil India during 1962-67 when the actual 
offtake of crude oil fell short of expectations. 

On return from leave on 3rd July 1961 Sahni refused to sign the 


supplementary agreement of 1961 on behalf of the government. A 
summary record was prepared of the negotiations and it revealed 
that the aforesaid decisions were taken during Sahni’s absence on 
leave. Naturally the Minister of State K.D. Malaviya and the Secre- 
tary S.S. Khera were much concerned about this revelation and even 
pressurised the Financial Adviser A. V. Venkateshwarn to say that 
Sahni had approved of the aforesaid clauses. Venkateshwaran refused 
to do so. Thereafter two record notes on loose sheets appeared my- 
steriously on the file which were not there before. Sahni then deman- 
ded an enquiry into the sudden appearance of these documents but 

the government did not agree to investigate. 

The Lok Sabha in its 51st Report of the Estimates Committee to 
the Fourth Lok Sabha; Oil India Limited (1967-68) page 55; in 1967- 
70 Annual Reports of Oil India Ltd., has been very critical of the 


^ Reducing the price paid by foreign oil companies on crude oil and 
petroleum products imported from abroad: The government during 
?957-61 had obtained an adhoc reduction of Rs 120 million per 



How oily was Oil 


113 


annum on product prices. During 1957-60 discounts of 20 to 25 cents 
off posted prices were considered routine in oil industry circles but 
the oil companies took shelter under the clause in the refineries 
agreement which permitted them to obtain crude oil from their own 
source and they could get no discounts. 

In 1960 the USSR offered crude oil at a discounted price to us. The 
government then pressed the foreign oil companies either to accept 
the USSR crude oil for processing in their refineries or to reduce 
their prices. During 1961-65, world market prices for lighter crude 
were 30 to 45 cents per barrel below posted prices and for medium 
and heavy crude 30 cents a barrel as against posted prices, whereas 
India had to be content with a discount of 19 cents per barrel granted 
in 1960 and . further discount of two cents a barrel in 1962, 

Increase in the indigenous refinery capacities: In 1957 the govern- 
ment established Indian Refineries Limited to set up two refineries at 
Gauhati and Barauni and a further refinery at Koyali. 

Oil .Companies were also pressurized to import tailored crude oil 
to maximize production of deficit petroleum products. 

To build up lubricating oil manufacturing units and blending units in 
the country: Some units have been set up in the country but we still 
have to import. The government should take immediate action to step 
up production in the country. 

Use of Indian flag tankers for coastal as well as import of crude oil 
from Persian Gulf: The government established Western India Ship- 
ping Company in 1959 with the main object of acquiring tankers. It 
was subsequently merged with Eastern Shipping Company to form 
the Shipping Corporation of India. Initially the progress was not as 
fast as was expected owing to Stanvac having agreed to charter a 
vessel from Great Eastern shipping Company in which Minister K.D. 
Malaviya’s son-in-law Vasant Seth, had substantial interest. The 
price paid for the second hand vessel was much higher than initially 
indicated and secondly the vessel itself did not give satisfactory 
service to the charterers. The government was much concerned about 
this. As a result K.D. Malaviya got cold feet and requested the officials 
in the ministry not to send any papers connected with tankers to him 
but should, be sent to the Cabinet Minister Swaran Singh. However, 
when the government-owned Western India Shipping Company was 
almost ready to acquire a tanker, K.D. Malaviya butted in and 
agreed to Dr Teja being given permission to acquire a tanker in his 
private sector company instead of the government owned Western 
India shipping Company. 

Import of crude oil and petroleum products on barter basis andjor 



114 


My Days with Nehru 

Rupee payment: The government did not agree to bilateral agreements 
with the countries in the Persian Gulf area. However, we were able 
to obtain supplies from the USSR on a concessional basis and against 
rupee payment. The government established in 1958 Indian oil 
Company to market petroleum products produced from the public 
sector refineries and also to import deficit petroleum products from 
abroad. This company was subsequently merged with Indian Refine- 
ries Ltd. to form Indian Oil Corporation. 

Steps were also undertaken to cut down the consumption of petroleum 
products so as to reduce imports: not much economy was achieved. 
The Indian Institute for Petroleum was entrusted with the research 
for a more efficient kerosene lantern. Proposals for town gas distribu- 
tion were examined. Steps were also taken to start the use of gobar 
gas plants in the country-side. 

The World Bank had expressed unhappiness over Indian Govern- 
ment’s oil policy to do everytning in the government sector and were 
desirous that India should enlist the help of foreign oil companies for 
exploration, setting up of refineries, lubricating oil plants etc. The 
World Bank suggested Walter Levy, an independent oil expert, as 
a consultant to visit India. Levy spent three weeks in 1959 within the 
Ministry of Petroleum and also saw the public sector projects and 
had discussions with the oil companies operating in India. He was 
fully satisfied and endorsed our policy. His two recommendations 
were firstly to prevail on foreign oil companies to use tailored ci ude 
for maximizing production of deficit products in the country and to 
step up ONGC’s drilling activities. 

Despite the severe handicap which India faced on account of 
foreign exchange shortage and lack of know-how in oil technology 
considerable progress was made on the oil front. Unfortunately 
Sahni’s association was brought to a sudden end. Salmi’s refusal to 
sign Oil India’s supplementary agreement of 1961; his demand for an 
enquiry into the appearance on government file of two mysterious 
documents; "^refusal to recommend Damle Committee s Oil Policy 
proposals and refusal to promote Phillips Patroleum and Duncan 
Brothers proposal for a refinery at Cochin perhaps led to K.D. 
Malaviya and S.S. Khera in October 1961 to abolish, as a measure of 
economy, the post of Joint Secretary in the Ministry and to post Sahni 
to a project. Sahni had signed his contract of service for three years 
with the government on 27 May 1961. He rejected with contempt the 
offer of an equivalent post in a government corporation and resigned. 
Within a few months of the acceptance of his resignation the same 
two persons recreated the post of Joint Secretary and posted a pliable

115 


and an ignorant ICS official. 

The working of the ICS league is inscrutable. An ICS officer who 
failed in the setting up of the Gauhati Refinery, was kicked up to 
the position of Chairman, Hindustan Steel Limited. In Sahni’s case, 
Khera gave the following evidence before the Takru Commission in 
reply to a question from the Counsel for the Ministry of Petroleum 
and Chemicals; 

Q. It is alleged against you Mr. Khera; If I may put it, that it 
was with some motivation that you got rid of Mr. Sahni. 

A. Nothing could be more false or mischievous than to make 
that sort of allegation. I had a high regard for Mr. Sahni’s qualities 
and his general attitude in oil policies. I believe much of his view 
coincided with mine and 1 think my views were somewhat stronger 
than the views of Mr. Sahni. They also coincided to a very large 
extent to the views of the Minister-in-charge of the Ministry and 
therefore, 1 would have no hesitation in saying that such an allega- 
tion or imputation would be false, frivolous and mischievous. 

The lapses as referred to earlier do not appear to confirm Khera’s 
contention that his views were somewhat stronger than the views of 
Sahni as far as the Public Sector was concerned. 

Sahni in his letter of resignation to the Prime Minister mentioned 
that the association of experienced people in the Boards of the Public 
Sector ventures was very desirable. Indian Oil Company is a typical 
example where the Board is composed of politicians and bureacrats 
with no oil experience, with the result that its performance leaves a 
lot to be desired. Sahni further mentioned ‘T remain convinced that 
the oil job at the headquarters of a government cannot be adequately 
discharged by any normal civil servant. Had it been otherwise the 
Government of India would not have sanctioned extra ocean freight 
amounting to about Rs. seven crores per annum to foreign oil com- 
panies in India following the Suez crisis. Even Pakistan refused to 
consider such a demand from these oil companies. The most impor- 
tant result of Khera’s letter terminating my appointment is that the 
foreign oil companies in India, who had been after my blood ever 
since I joined government, were jubilant over their success.” 

To break the hold of the oil companies in the country was a diffi- 
cult task indeed. Sahni with support from me and with the blessings 
and backing of Nehru succeeded despite the severe opposition of the 
vested interest within the government and outside it and the tremen- 
dous pressure of the all powerful oil companies who had brain-washed 



116 




My Days with Nehru 

the politicians and officials and convinced the people at large that oil 
was a risky business and the prospect of finding oil in India was 
negligible, very capital intensive and Indians were not capable of 
imbibing oil techniques. 

Sahni recommended our pil policy must be sufficient!}' comprehen- 
sive to hasten the development of our indigenous oil resources, build 
up our refining capacity atleast in line with our requirements— pro- 
jected for both short and long time periods, and to ensure, through 
efficient and up-to-date distribution throughout India, adequate and 
uninterupted supplies at economic prices. 

The Indian Oil Corporation Limited has grow’n in size, with the 
current annual sales of about Rs 3,000 crores but the profitability is 
low and the cumulative reserves and surplus are negligible as com- 
pared with public sector enterprises in other countries and with the 
oil prices having increased five fold from 1972 todate. The private 
sector companies, both refining and marketing, have been national- 
ized and even today they continue to operate in the manner as before. 
There is no move to nationalize their distribution system and econo- 
mize, whereas on the other hand the refiners’ process margin recently 
has been increased from Rs 17 to Rs 50 per ton. 

Experts are concerned that the delay on part of the government to 
undertake a gas fractionation plant at the Uran terminal will result in 
enormous national loss. In June 1977 the ONGC had indicated to the 
World Bank that engineering consultants for the terminal at Uran had 
been selected, whereas in reality no consultants had been appointed 
even as late as the end of October 1978. 

The process I helped to initiate with Sahni early' in 1956 to 
eliminate exploitation by foreign oil companies was, ironically enough, 
completed by the oil-producing Arabs, Iranians and others successfully 
exploiting the exploiters. This exploitation of the exploiters has also 
landed innocent countries, including India, in trouble. Like Euro- 
communism and Euro-dollar, Petro-dollar has become a fact of life. 
Perhaps in the future petro-communism will also emerge. 

Notes: 

Burmalt Oil Company was a blue chip share on the London market. It 
started with producing and refining oil in Burmah which was followed up will) 
the oil-find in Assam where production and refining were handled by Assam 
Oil Company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary company of the Burmah Oil 
Cpmpany. In Assam, oil was -actually discovered by oil marks on an elephant's 
paws whilst carrying timber. This is very similar to our own experience in 
Cambay where we found oil for the first time. Our drill was spudding in at a 
village called “Teelwah”— (Teel means oil). This village had a perennial flame 
of gas for many centuries. 



How oily was Oil 


117 


Burmah Oil Company also had a 25 per cent stake in British Petroleum. 
With their interests in Burmah having been nationalized and their influence in 
Assam considerably reduced, Burmah Oil Company started diversifying ant^ 
acquired oil interests in the United States, and organized a shipping terminal in 
West Indies and went for tankers including vessels for LNG (Liquid Natural 
Gas). All these were expensive enterprises and they found that they were too 
extended and went bankrupt almost overnight some four years back. Their one 
Pound share was quoted around five Pounds and overnight slid down to 30 
pence. 

A Greek by name Kulukundas took them for a ride. The same Greek had 
come to Sahni with Dharma Teja for setting up a tanker company in India. 
His proposition was a fantastic one and Sahni more or less told him to go out 
by the door through which he and Teja had come in. Teja then mentioned that 
he had Prime Minister Nehru's blessings for their proposal; but, when Sahni 
asked his PA to connect him to the Prime Minister's office to obtain the Prime 
Minister’s confirmation, Teja got cold feet and told him not to telephone but 
to seek the Prime Minister's guidance when he met him next. Teja never saw 
Sahni again. 

The British Government came to the assistance of the Burmah Oil Company 
by providing a bank guarantee to prevent the Company from going into liquida- 
tion. For this the British Government aquired their 25 per cent share in British 
Petroleum for a song. 

During the last year the Burmah Oil Company have reduced losses from 
shipping and with income from Indonesian Liquid Natural Gas operations and 
an initial contribution from the Thistle Oil fields in the North Sea having shown 
about three million Pounds profits in the first half of 1978 which compared with 
the loss of 1,3 million Pounds in the corresponding period of the previous year. 
They have also recently sold their Cooper Basin interest in Australia. 

Assam Oil Company still carries on with its depleting oil-field and an 
outmoded refinery. Discussions are going on with the Government of India with 
a view to government taking over these assets and also Burmah Oil Company’s 
50 per cent share-holding in Oil India Ltd. 

Oil India Ltd %vas established in 1958 with the Government of India taking 
one-third share-holding and the Burmah Oil Company the remaining. In 1961 
the Government’s share-holding was stepped up to 50 per cent. Oil India’s 
agreement benefitted the Burmah Oil Company very substantially and it also 
enabled them to go* in for diversification elsewhere. 

British Petroleum is one of the “seven sisters.” The British government had 
a 40 per cent share-holding in British petroleum; and now they have a majority 
share-holding with the acquisition of Burmah Oil Company's holding. It was 
Winston Churchill who insisted on the British government taking 40 per cent 
share-holding in the company just before the outbreak of the First World War. 
His decision proved to be a financial asset to the British government. British 
Petroleum has adv-inced a great deal. They have substantial interest in the 
North Sea Forties Field and also in the Alaska oil fields. They have taken over 
a substantial share-holding in Sohio, a major “independent” in America. Their 
Sales revenue for a year are over 10 billion Pounds and their pre-tax income is 
about two billion Pounds a year. . 



1 6 Nehru and A dminibtration 


A statesman need not necessarily be a good administrator. A combi- 
nation of the two is devoutly to be wished, but bow rarely does this 
occur! Neither Winston Churchill nor Nehru were good administra- 
tors. But unlike the Prime Minister in the United Kingdom, Nehru 
saddled himself with more than one portfolio— External Affairs and 
Atomic Energy and Scientific Research — on a permanent basis. 

Externa] Affairs, not so much Atomic Energy and Scientific 
Research, needed a great deal of administrative attention. Nehru had 
neither the aptitude, the patience, the inclination nor the temperament 
for the drudgery of attention to details. In fact he was a man whose 
policies could be largely defeated at the level of details by scheming 
men. Nehru’s choice of junior ministers directly under him left much 
•to be desired. In any event, having been for so long his own secretary 
during his long career as a political leader, Nehru never learned to 
delegate. With only one exception, the junior ministers under Nehru 
were the most neglected and disgruntled ones in the whole govern- 
ment. The one exception was Dr Syud Mahmud who, I believe, was 
older than Nehru — in any event very much dilapidated. He was a dear 
old man in whom there was no guile and was not keen on loading 
himself with work. After his appointment, I made a list of old men 
who were junior ministers who, in my view, should either be Presi- 
dent ornothing. I gave the list to the Prime Minister and asked “What 
is the purpose of such appointments?” and commented that they had 
passed the age of learning and being trained for the future. He 
agreed, but said that in ministry-making he had to have a variety of 
considerations especially because of the vastness and infinite variety of 
the country. About Dr Syud Mohmud, he said that he had to be reco- 
gnised in some way in spite of a political lapse and, as a minister, the 
only suitable place for him W'as to be under him; in fact he was not 
likely to agree to work under anyone else. 

One day S.K. Patil asked me privately why the Prime Minister was 
not encouraging any one or a group of colleagues to come up. I repli- 
ed that he might as well reconcile himself to the fact that notl.ing 
would grow under a banyan tree. The same evening Patil blurted it out 
in Bombay as his own statement. 



Nehru and Administration 


119 


I have come across the members of all the Services known by many 
names — All India Services, Superior Services, the Secretary of State 
Services — Comprising the Indian Civil Service (ISC), Indian Educa- 
tional Service (lES), Indian Audit and Accounts Service (lA &amp; AS), 
Indian Political Service, Indian Forest Service (IFS), Indian Medical 
Service (IMS), and Indian Police (IP). Barring the Indian Medical 
Service (IMS), I found nothing superior about any of them. There was 
nothing political about the Indian political service which was compos- 
ed of some carefully-selected British ICS Officers who served as resi- 
dents in the various Indian states, with K.P.S. Menon thrown in, and 
some army duds. Members of the Indian Political Service, apart from 
serving in the residencies in Indipn states, were also posted in Tibet 
and Sikkim and in the tribal areas of North-West Frontier Province. 
K.P.S. Menon did well in getting out of the Political Department be- 
cause he had no scope for advancement in it. Ke could never hope to 
be a Resident in an Indian state. Members of the Indian Civil Service 
(ICS) were the most arrogint and perhaps the most ignorant com- 
pared to other services which they considered as inferior. 

An ancient Greek philosopher went round Athens in daylight with 
a torch to find an honest man, but failed. The same would have been 
the fate if one looked for a versatile man in the “Superior Services.” 
But one could find many “yes men” and “no men” among them. It was 
rarely that one could come 'across any one who was interested in any 
thing outside the files he had to deal with. And yet many of these men 
were bright young people when they got into the services through 
competitive examination. When a man opts for security many things 
in him die. Security has a deadening effect and is a killer of persona- 
lity. Those who opt for security are not the ones v,ho would take the 
world forward. They are condemned to security, a reasonaly comfor- 
table life, a good wife if lucky, a house at the fag end of the career, 
and purposeless idleness with an inadequate pension — always thinking 
and talking of the past. 

With Independence India had to develop a new service — the Indian 
Foreign Service. To begin with, people in different age groups were 
needed to fill the cadre. Girja Shankar Bajpai, Secretary-General of 
the External Affairs Ministry, told the Prime Minister that the Union 
Public Service Commission was unsuitable to select persons for the 
diplomatic service. He recommended the settingup of a Special Selec- 
tion Board for the purpose. Without much thought Nehru agreed. The 
Special Selection Board consisted of Lala Sir Sliri Ram as Chairman, 
the Foreign Secretary; the Commonwealth Secretary, and the Com- 
merce Secretary as members. Most people knew that Bajpai was 



120 


My Days with Nehru 

indebted to Lala Shri Ram who always prized any recognition by any 
government of the day. He was a self-made man living like a hermit 
in his old age. He was fit enough to be Chairman of a Committee 
on Cotton Yarn but singularly unsuitable to head a Board to 
select personnel for the diplomatic service. But he had to be accommo- 
dated because, unknown to the Prime Minister, Bajpai’s indebtedness 
had to be redeemed. 

The fruits of labour of the Special Selection Board left much to be 
desired. All the members of the Board had their own favourites and 
candidates. Bajpai, though not a member of the Board, functioned 
through Lala Shri Ram. Many people with the right connections and 
some who did not have the minimum educational qualifications enter- 
ed the foreign service through the back-door. Leilaraani Naidu, the 
second daughter of Sarojini Naidu, was also taken in. Unlike Ranbir 
Singh and Mohommad Yunus, she had ample educational qualifica- 
tions and teaching experience, but was thoroughly temperamental and 
patently unsuitable for any diplomatic work. She had to be kept in the 
External Affairs Ministry throughout her term in the Foreign Service 
as a lame duck. 

A mini special Selection 'Beard was constituted in London with 
Prof. Harold Laski, Girja Shanker Bajpai and Krishna Menon as 
members. It was through this Selection Board that P.N. Haksar and 
four or five members of Krishna Menon’s personal staff", including 
Kamala Jaspal, found their way into the Foreign Service. 

The selection of the first batch of young persons to fill the annual 
quota for the Foreign Service was done by the Union Public Service 
Commission. Before the time for the selection for the second year’s 
quota came, Bajpai complained to the Prime Minister about the “utter 
unsuitability” of the UPSC for selecting personnel for the diplomatic 
service and recommended the revival of the Special Selection Board. I 
was horrified at the effrontery of Bajpai and wanted to prevent a repe- 
tition of favouritism and nepotism. I told the Prime Minister that the 
first batch of young people selected for the Indian Foreign Service by 
UPSC were then probationers at the Ministry of External Affairs and 
suggested his meeting them individually and gather some impressions 
about them. He did not have the patience. He asked me to interview 
them individually and convey my impression to him. I met each one 
of them and informed the Prime Minister that man for man they were 
superior to any selected by the Special Selection Board. I also told 
him about the well-founded criticism of the functioning of the Special 
Selection Board in the past. The Prime Minister rejected Bajpai’s pro- 



Nehru and Administration 


121 


posal. Thus the ad hoc Special Selection Board was given the burial 
never to be revived again. 

The man closely connected with administration, the longest in 
External Affairs Ministry right from its inception till almost about the 
death of Nehru, with a spell abroad as Ambassador in Bonn and a 
very brief spell in Moscow, was a blue-eyed boy of Bajpai — Subimal 
Dutt. He was a hard-working man, as inflexible as an iron rod. He 
was born to be a desk-man devoid of the qualities of what might be 
called a “field man.” His Mongolian features and short stature prom- 
pted junior officers to refer to him as General Tojo. He lacked perso- 
nality and was almost a recluse. He was not endowed with superfi^cial 
social graces and hardly knew how to entertain. How be managed as 
Ambassador in Bonn was a wonder to many. The loss of his wife and 
his only son made him desolate and he sent an urgent and earnest 
appeal to the Prime Minister to withdraw him from Moscow and to 
give him a light assignment in Delhi. He was appointed as Secretary 
to the President. On his return from Moscow he told me that he would 
soon be retiring and that it was his intention to renounce the world 
and join the Ramakrishna Mission. I could not believe that an ICS 
official had the capacity for renunejation and came to the conclusion 
that he was suffering from momentary depression. He retired in the 
normal course; soon thereafter became Vigilance Officer in the West 
Bengal government; then came over to Delhi as Vigilance Commis- 
sioner: and subsequently went to Dacca as India’s first High Commis- 
sioner in Bangladesh. He had the distinction of achieving the most 
difficult thing — “renouncing the renunciation.” Of Dutt it can be said 
that he was a typical official who sat so long behind a desk, that wood 
entered his soul. 

Soon after the Special Selection Board completed its task of whole- 
sale recruitment of personnel forthe Foreign Service, K.R. Narayanan 
came to see me with a letter of introduction from Prof. Harold Laski 
addressed to the Prime Minister. He is a '■’^Ptdayan" just above the 
“Pariash" community which is the lowest among the outcastes in India. 
He comes from a place which is only about ten miles from my home 
in Travancore (Kerala). He w-as a good student and earned a Tata 
scholarslrip to go to England for studies at the London School of 
Economics and Political Science. After completion of his studies he 
came to Delhi in the hope of seeing the Prime Minister. KTishna 
Menon had advised him to come straight to me and to avoid any official 
in the External Affairs Ministry. So he came to me. In his letter Laski 
had written that Narayanan w'as a young man of intellectual distinc- 
tion. Naryanan was over-age to appear for the UPSC examination. 



122 


My Days with Nehru 

He was anxious to get gainful employment as soon as possible. I tried 
to persuade him to join the Delhi School of Economics and take 
interest in public affairs. I looked upon him as a better edition of 
Jagjivan Ram in the public life of the future. He, however, explained 
to me the need for a well-paid job with security so that he could ren- 
der some financial assistance to his parents and other members of the 
family. He expressed a preference for the Foreign Service. I knew an 
immediate interview with the Prime Minister would lead him nowhere 
So I asked Narayanan to wait in Delhi for four or five daj's and assur- 
ed him that I would send for him. 

On the way home from the office that day I showed the Prime 
Minister Laski’s letter and told him what transpired at Narayanan’s 
meeting with me. I said that in a case like this, rules should be broken 
to accommoda.te the young man the like of whom it was difficult to find 
among the Scheduled Castes. Knowing his distate for sponsoring indi- 
viduals, I told him that, if he had no objection, I would like to see 
Home Minister Sardar Patel to request him to treat it as a special case 
and ask Mr Hejmadi, Chairman of the UPSC, to arrange for the com- 
mission to interview Narayanan and select him for the Foreign 
Service if found suitable. The Prime Minister readily agreed. The ne.xt 
day I met Sardar Patel who was most helpful and understanding. He 
read Prof Laski’s letter. He told me “you leave the matter to me; I 
shall send you a message soon.” To my suggestion that he might see 
Narayanan he said “it is not necessary; you have spoken tome and I 
have seen Laski’s letter, that is enough.” I reported the matter to the 
Prime Minister and also arranged for Narayanan to see him. After 
seeing Narayanan, the Prime Minister ."^poke to the Secretary-General 
Girja Shanker Bajpai and handed over to him Laski’s letter. Bajpai 
met Narayanan and forwarded the letter to the Foreign Secretary with 
the C3'nical remark that if Narayanan had intellectual distinction, he 
had succeeded in hiding it from him. In the meantime I received a 
message from Sardar Patel to say that Hegmadi had suggested, as a 
special case, that a committee consisting of the Foreign Secretary, 
Commonwealth Secretary and the Commerce Secretary might inter- 
view Narayanan and make a recommendation to tie UPSC which 
would accept it. That is now Narayanan got into the Foreign Service 
and chose security in preference to a life of uncertainty and adventure. 

Some years letter Narayanan came to see me again. He was then a 
First Secretary at our Embassy in Burma. He came to know a Burmese 
girl in Rangoon and they decided to get married. A member of the 
Foreign Service has to obtain formal permission from the External 
Affairs Ministry to marry a foreign woman and, along with the appli- 



Nehru and Administration 


123 


cation for permission, has to submit a formal letter of resignation from 
the Foreign Service, Narayanan was perturbed because the Foreign 
Secretary happened to be S. Dutt who had a reputation of being rigid 
and unhelpful in such matters. Narayanan was worried about the 
possibility of the resignation being accepted. He told me that it was 
impossible to find a suitable bride, with adequate education, from his 
own community and, because of the strong caste prejudices in India, 
it was difficult to find a suitable match from any other community. I 
told him not to worry and advised him to put in his application and 
resignation. I also told him that it would be undesirable to give any 
one the impression that he had met me because it might offend the 
officials concerned. He left after I told him not to have sleepless nights 
over the matter. I spoke to Dutt about Narayanan and told him that 
it was a very deserving case and that I would not like to be placed in 
a position of having to speak to the Prime Minister about it. Dutt was 
noncommittal; but I was not bothered because the final decision lay 
elsewhere. Some days later Dutt sent the file about Narayanan to the 
PM recommending permission for the young man to marry the 
Burmese girl. 

Narayanan’s case is yet another condemnation of the barbarous 
and irrational inbuilt prejudices which corrode our social fabric. Only 
wolves equal Indians in caste consciousness. They have a social cere- 
monial and caste system. It took 33 pages in a scientific journal to des- 
cribe all the ceremonial attitudes and symbolic gestures of a pack of 
wolves. The attitude of the head, the ears, the bristling of certain por- 
tions of the fur, the wrinkling of the brow, the degree to which the 
teeth are bared and, above all, the way the tail is held arc strictly pres- 
cribed. If a low-ranking wolf approaches the big chief with her tail 
in the air, she is just as likely, as not, to be put to death. Her tail 
must stay under her belly as though it were glued there. A middle- 
class wolf may let her tail hang down freely in the presence of the 
chief, but woe unto her if, through ignorance or delusions of grand- 
eur, she lifts it above the horizontal. 

With all his handicaps, Naraj'anan has progressed in the Service 
and has recently retired as the Indian Ambassador to the People’s 
Republic of China. Since then he has been appointed as the Vice- 
Chancellor of the Jawaharlai Nehru University, New Delhi. 

At about the same time Captain Narendra Singh, who used to be 
ADC to Lord Mountbatten, and was later taken into the Foreign Ser- 
vice, came to see me with his tale of matrimonial woe. He belonged 
to a minor princely family and was married to a girl from another 
minor princely clan. Immediately after the marriage, which was an 



124 


My Days ii’/V/i Nehru 

arranged one, Ihe girl ran away and refused to live with the husband 
Narendra Singh said that the girl’s brother, who was in the Foreign 
Service, was prepared to testify to the veracity of his statements. I told 
Narendra Singh that I did not wish to constitute myself as a marriage 
counselling Bureau and asked him to see the Foreign Secretary' Subi- 
mal Dutt. He said I have seen General Tojo, who, being incurably 
rigid, sounded very unhelpful.” The girl he wanted to marry was a 
European. I asked him why he could not find a nice Indian girl. He 
explained that he was out of India and had no opportunity to get to 
know any Indian girls and that he dreaded another arranged marriage. 
I asked him to leave the matter to “General Tojo” and to God. The 
next day I had a word with Dutt. It seemed that God worked, for within 
a few days the file about Narendra Singh came to the Prime Minister 
from Dutt reluctantly recommending that permission for the marriage 
might be given. 

During the first half of 1956 De Mello Kamath, member of the 
Foreign Service, came to see me in great distress. He said he had been 
dismissed from service for certain financial transactions which took 
place while he was Consul-General in Saigon. The situation in 
Vietnam during that period was abnormal, unsettled and fluid. What 
type of transactions took place will be clear from Foreign Secretary 
Subimal Dutt’s note dated 1 June 1956 which is quoted in full later in 
this chapter. He said a great injustice had been done to him because 
he had done nothing which his predecessor A.N. Mehta (Ashok Mehta 
who later married Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit’s eldest daughter Chandra- 
lekha) had not done. The only difference, according to him, was that 
in his case a substantial part of the money which came to him re- 
mained in his bank account in India while in the case of A.N. Mehta 
what accrued was cleverly spent on the acquisition of substantial 
items like expensive American and German movie and still cameras, 
movie projector, other photographic equipment, radiogram, record 
player, music records, deep freeze, frigidaire, car, and other foreign 
household goods. 

A little later Chandralekha and Ashok Mehta came wailing to see 
me in the Prime Minister’s House. The enquiry officer had completed 
the evidence relating to A.N. Mehta’s case. Both Chandralekha and 
Ashok were jittery. Mehta had bis say. I told him that I had no doubt 
that his case would be linked with that of De Mello Kamath which 
would be reviewed. 

The next day I spoke to Subimal Dutt about the two cases, I told 
him that it appeared to me that the External Affairs Ministry should 
be in the dock and not the two officers; the whole thing was a sad 



Nehru and Administration 


125 


commentary on the incompetence and laxity on the part of the Exter- 
nal Affairs Ministry. Not only these two people but several Indian 
ambassadors and others in East Asia, Southeast Asia and some in East 
European countries had misbehaved even worse. Dutt said that the 
Union Public Service Commission had already disposed of the case of 
De Mello Kamath. I said that the UPSC will have to be given addi- 
tional facts about the melancholy role of the External Affairs Ministry 
in this sorry business to enable that body to review the position; and 
that in any event the case of the De Mello Kamath and A.N. Mehta 
must be linked; and that I shall see to it that the Prime Minister does 
not deal with this matter as A.N. Mehta is married to his niece, and 
consequently the Finance Minister will be asked to deal with it. I add- 
ed that the Prime Minister had given a free hand to the officials in the 
administration of the Ministry of External Affairs and its far-flung 
missions abroad, and that the ministry had not covered itself with 
glory. Dutt realised that I meant business. He got busy. Ultimately 
De Mello Kamath’s dismissal was revoked and he was reinstated and 
posted as India’s Commissioner in Hong Kong. A.N. Mehta escaped 
with the mild punishment of having been conveyed government’s 
displeasure. I reproduce below, in full. Foreign Secretary S. Dutt’s 
note dated 1 June 1965, entitled “Proceedings against Shri A.N. 
Mehta” a signed copy of which he sent to me. The Foreign Secretary 
■note throws light on the whole situation and the sorry state of admi- 
nistration in the Ministry of External Affairs. 

Proceedings Against Shri A.N. Mehta 

“I have given careful, prolonged and anxious consideration to the 
facts of this case. This is not only because the charges on the face 
of them are serious but also because they concern a young officer, 
with an extremely good record of service, in relation to certain 
transactions which took place eight to nine years ago. I could have 
disposed of these proceedings earlier but similar proceedings have 
been drawn up against some other persons who also served in Indo- 
china at or about the time Shri A.N. Mehta was employed there 
and I wanted to see whether any facts have transpired in course of 
the inquires against these other persons which would be relevant 
to the present proceedings. This explains the delay in passing final 
orders in the present case. 

2. I have carefully gone through the report of the Inquiring 
officer. This is a clear and, on the whole, concise document and has 
dealt with all facts of the case fairly and impartially. I have also 



126 


My Days with A’ehru 



carefully considered Shri A.N. Mehta’s explanation contained in 
his letter of January 31, 1956, addressed to the Inquiring Officer 
and record of the long oral statement made by him on February 21, 
1956, before the Inquiring Officer. 

3. I agree with the finding of the Inquiring Officer on Charge 
No. 1 for the reasons mentioned by him. It is true that the practice 
of obtaining local currency in Indo-china against rupee drafts issu- 
ed in India was irregular, but the inquiring officer has given full 
reasons why he considers that no mala fide intention was involved 
and that had it not been for this procedure which government had 
officially sanctioned at Chungking for the Indian Agency- General 
and later for the Indian embassy at Nanking, Shri Mehta and his 
staff could riot have made both ends meet in Indo-China. Condi- 
tions in Indo-China were not dissimilar from those in Chungking 
and were certainly worse, if anything, than those in Nanking. The 
allowance sanctioned by government were admittedly inadequate; 
for months the officer (Shri Mehta) was without his pay and allow- 
ances; there was no definite guidance from Headquarters cither 
about accounting procedure or as to how he could have lived on the 



Nehru and Administration 


127 


allowances sanctioned somewhat belatedly by government. In the 
circumstances 1 do not think that it lies in government to find fault 
with the officer. And, as I shall show in the subsequent paragraphs, 
the officer had not made any illegal gain by resort to the transactions 
which form the subject of Charge No. 1. For all these reasons, I 
acquit Shri A.N. Mehta of Charge No. 1. 

4. Charge No. 2 is more difficult. It consists of two parts; (a) 
that Shri Mehta introduced an irregular practice of claiming room 
rent for hotel accommodation and house rent for stalf in pay bills in 
Indian rupees; and (6) that by selling rupee cheques in India against 
the amount thus drawn as house rent, he secured more piastres 
locally than the liability incurred by him on hotel or house rent. 

5. Part (a) of this charge cannot be sustained. As I have said 
earlier, no definite guidance was given to the Officer about the 
accounting procedure. Here was a young man whose only experi- 
ence of civil work was limited to the period from May 1943 to 
January 1945 when he served in the Indian Agency-General in 
Chungking. The Officer was sent off to Indo-China without any 
definite instruction about accounting procedure and with no accoun- 
ting assist tree. In fact I can say from personal experience that 
the accounting. rules and procedure had to be developed in the new 
Ministry of External Affairs over a period of years and at the time 
Shri Mehta proceeded to Saigon (in December 1946) there was 
hardly any regular accounting procedure. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that he should have introduced a practice which he saw 
followed at Chungking. And I cannot reject as entirely irrelevant 
his contention that at no time was any exception taken to this pro- 
cedure of drawing house rent in pay bill. 

6. Part (6) of this charge remains to be dealt with. The Inquir- 
ing Officer has come to the conclusion that by issuing rupee chequ- 
es in India against the amount drawn as house rent and acquiring 
piastres from the local Indians in Saigon, Shri Mehta got into 
possession of more piastres than he had to pay as house rent. The 
circumstances in wliich rupee cheques were drawn against his rupee 
account in India on his pay bill have been dealt with by the Inquir- 
ing Officer in full in dealing with Charge No. 1. These have been 
referred to briefly above. The question, therefore, is whether by 
acquiring piastres locally against the amoimt in rupees drawn in 
India on account of house rent Shri Mehta made illegal profit. In 
order to satisfy myself on this point. I have looked into Shri 
Mehta's bank accormls in India. I find that during the period 
November 1946 to January 1949. i.e. two years and nine months. 



128 


My Days with Nehru 


Shri Mehta’s bank accounts in India (maintained in the Chartered 
Bank of India, Australia and China, Bombay, and in the Bank of 
Baroda, Bombay) show a net credit balance of Rs. 3,273. All his 
remittances from Indo-China consisted of his pay and house rent. 
The average monthly saving comes to Rs. 104. This cannot be 
said to be an unusally large saving for a bachelor. I am satisfied 
that Shri Mehta did not resort to the procedure, which has formed 
the subject of charge No. 2, against him in order to defraud 
government or to make illicit gain. All the same, it should have 
occurred to him that since the house rent was being incurred local- 
ly in piastres, it was not proper to secure a large amount of piastr- 
es by resort to the practice of drawing it in rupees in pay bill. Shri 
Mehta should not, therefore, have adopted this procedure even 
though no objection had been taken by audit. The question, how- 
ever, is what action should be taken against Shri Mehta for having 
adopted this practice. In deciding on this, I have got to take into 
account the following facts: 

(i) As already stated, a very junior officer was sent at short 
notice to a disturbed country without any definite instruction as to 
how he was to maintain accounts or to draw his pay and allo- 
wances. 

fii) His allowances were admittedly inadequate to the high cost 
of living prevailing in Indo-China where the official value of the 
piastre had no relation to its real value. Under similar conditions 
in Chungking, where only the officer had previous experience of 
civil work, government had formally sanctioned the practices which 
he followed in Saigon. 

(iii) No proper accounting or other rules had been laid down 
by Government for offices abroad; conditions of service in count- 
ries abroad for Indian personnel had not been properly fixed; the 
officer was left to his own resources on inadequate allowances to 
discharge his functions as government of India’s representative 
under difficult conditions in a disturbed country. 

(iv) Similar practices were followed by the more established 
Embassies and Missions in Indo-China. 

(v) Government themselves had sanctioned resort to the prac- 
tice to obtaining currency locally' from Indian merchants against 
rupee cheques given to them from Government accounts in India, 
for meeting certain Government obligations. 

7. Having regard to the circumstances mentioned above and 
particularly to the fact that Shri Mehta’s record of service since he 
left Indo-China has been extremely satisfactory, I consider that it 



Nehru and Administration 


129 


would not be fair to inflict any severe punishment on him for what 
happened in extraordinary circumstances eight/nine years ago. I 
have therefore, come to the conclusion that the ends of justice will 
be met by conveying government’s displeasure to Shri Mehta for 
having drawn his house rent in pay bill in India and for acquiring 
against this amount a large amount in local currency than he had 
to pay as house rent in Saigon. 

(S. Dutt)” 

I know the case of a senior career ambassador who managed to 
import four flamboyant Cadillac cars, purchased abroad at diplomatic 
concessional prices, into India free of duty in eight years and sold at 
fantastic prices to some Maharajas who enjoyed tax-free privy purses. 
I know another career ambassador who took his mother-in-law from 
India to South America as a “servant” at government expense. I knew 
a “public man” from Kashmir, who was included in the Indian dele- 
gation to the UN for the Kashmir meet in Geneva under the late N. 
Gopalasw’ami Ayyangar, drawing 100 Swiss Francs from the entertain- 
ment account every day for a prostitute. He proposed and, under 
Indira regime, became an ambassador and a cabinet minister. 

At the Ministry of External Affairs I learn’t the lesson that it is 
unwise to leave administration wholly to “administrators.^’ The 
administration of the External Affairs Ministry and its missions abroad 
under Nehru was nothing short of lousy. The Air India offices abroad 
were better and more useful than many of India’s missions abroad. 

The Ford Foundation in India produced an American called Ap- 
plebee as an expert on “administration.” It involved no expenditure on 
the part of the Government of India. The Ford Foundation paid all 
his travelling and for his stay here. Nehru spent much time on Apple- 
bee and his reports. I did not find his reports of any great value, 
Applebee, obviously encouraged by some civil servants in India, star- 
ted espousing their cause and extolling individuals to the Prime Mini- 
ster. I cautioned the Prime Minister against this and also said that 
there was much to learn from America but not in administration. I 
also told him that British administration within the British Isles (not 
in India) was fax superior to the American and we have much to learn 
from the British system. 

Lenin almost had a measure of contempt for administration w'hich, 
he thought, consisted of filing clerks and cooks. Immediately after the 
“Great October Revolution,” the principal lieutenants of Lem'n asked 
him “where do we go from here?” Lenin, who had hardly given any 
conrideration to the subject of administration, thought for a moment 



130 My Days with Nehni 

and said “start with nationalization of all banks and then feel your 
way about.” 

1 do not blame Nehru too much for his lack of interest in admini- 
stration for, in our own life-time there existed a hard-working British 
ICS official in India who wrote the Fundamental Rules and found the 
document so involved and confusing that he had to sit and write the 
Supplementary Rules, and then went insane. But for the insanity he 
might have gone on and on and produced a modern Panchatantra. In 
the administration of modern India the Fundamental Rules and Sup- 
plementary Rules continue to be as important and pervasive as the 
Napoleonic Code does in modern France. 


17 Nehru and Security Arrangements 


Nothing caused more irritation and annoyance to Nehru than his secu- 
rity arrangements. It was a running battle with the police and Intelli- 
gence. It started in 1946, Intensified itself during the period of the par- 
tition upheaval, reached the peak after the assassination of Gandhi, 
and was stabilised at that extravagantly fantastic level. A graph of it 
will compare well with price rise. Prices tend to shoot up and often 
the peak level eventually becomes “normal” and people will get used 
to it. The only exception took place in Germany under the early part 
of the Third Reich while Dr Hjalmar Schacht, the “financial wizard,” 
was Minister of National Economy (1934-37). Chancellor Adolph 
Hitler directed Schacht to provide unlimited funds for armament 
manufacture. Schacht protested saying that the economic consequen- 
ces would be disastrous and that uncontrollable inflation with the inevi- 
table runaway prices would prevail. Hitler was unmoved. He reitera- 
ted his demand saying “inflation and the rest of it need not be your 
worries, my S.S. will look after them.” Now there is a second excep- 
tion — in the Soviet Union and the group of “socialist” countries where 
regimentation rules the roost. 

Nehru soon found that his car was preceded by a pilot car full of 
plain-clothed policemen armed with revolvers, and followed by an 
escort car fitted with radio and full of uniformed policemen with rifles 
and sten guns. Police lined both sides of the road and traffic was 
stopped causing great inconvenience to the public. The first day Nehru 
noticed these, he was furious. On our way to office he stopped the car 
at Vijay Chowk and got out of it. At his instance I summoned the pilot 
car which served no purpose except to raise dust. The pilot car was 
asked to go off the road. On reaching his office, Nehru sent for the 
Director of the Intelligence Bureau and told him that the pilot car 
should be dispensed with; that there should be no police lining the 
route and that traffic should not be stopped. He said that lining of the 
route prior to his passing through was only giving advance notice to 
possible evil-doers; and that an element of surprise was the essence of 
security. As a concession, he allowed a police motor cycle rider in 
place of the pilot car. 

Nehru soon discovered that the practice of route-lining was conti- 



132 


My Days with Nehru 


nuing with plain-clothed policemen instead of uniformed ones. So he 
decided to apply the “break-through” principle. Without giving any 
notice to the security staff, he would go from his office in the evenings 
to Maulana Azad’s residence or to Pandit Pant’s residence before 
returning to the Prime Minister’s House— thus throwing the police 
arrangements into disarray. I also used to help in this. While the Flame 
of the Forest was in bloom in March, I would sometimes arrange for 
Nehru’s car to make a detour and drive over the ridge with the jungle 
on either side, cut across the road leading to Karol Bagh and proceed 
to the Secretariat viatheBirlaTemple. It was on oneof these unschedu- 
led drives that Nehru spotted and admired a site with a magnificent 
view. Later he was to choose this site on the hump of the ridge for the 
Buddha Jayanti Memorial Tower which, when completed, will put 
Qutab Minar in the shade. He took keen interest in the development 
of 12 parks in the sprawling adjoining area which is a boon to the 
people of Delhi and an attraction for visitors. 

White the gul mohar was in bloom exhibiting its resplendent colour 
in May, I would arrange for Nehru to give the slip to the police and 
go from the Secretariat in the evening, take a round of the inner cir- 
cle of Connaught Place where gul mohars abound, and then drive on 
to the Prime Minister’s House. Apart from having a change from the 
routine, Nehru took mischievous delight in playing pranks on the 
police. 

In the early years of independence, while foreign diplomatic mis- 
sions were few in New Delhi, it was Nehru’s practice to accept invita- 
tions to small dinner parties by ambassadors and High Commissioners 
and also attend their receptions. Reports reached Nehru that the police 
invaded their kitchens in advance and also supervised the cooking. 
This annoyed Nehru beyond measure. Shouting at the Intelligence and 
the police produced no results. Gradually Nehru gave up the practice 
of accepting inviations to meals outside. 

It was not the practice to give Nehru any eatables — sweets, fruits and 
other items — received from outside except those sent by well-known 
people. Even for the latter category the police suggested that they 
should be tasted by others first. I told the police that they should send 
their own food-tasters after insuring them heavily, for, 1 said, I 
intended to poison some of them occasionally. I heard no more about 
food-tasting. 

The police wanted one of their own men to sit outside the Prime 
Minister’s offices in the Secretariat, Parliament House, and the Prime 
Minister’s House. I agreed to it on condition that I selected them per- 
sonally and .that they were dressed as chaprasis. They were allowed to

have revolvers concealed on their persons. This encouraged the 
Intelligence Chief B.N. Mullick so much that he asked me to let him 
post a security guard outside the Prime Minister’s bedroom. I knew 
what reaction Nehru would have to this. I told Mullick the story of an 
English woman who sent, for publication, an article to the Editor of 
the London Times under the title “Why do I live?.” The Editor found 
the article stupid beyond words and returned it with a brief covering 
letter in which he wrote “I shall attempt to answer the question posed 
in the title of your article. The answer is because you sent it by posti” 
I told Mullick that it was safer to send a note to the Prime Minister 
than raising the matter personally with him. Mullick never sent the 
note! 

Nehru did not follow Gandhi’s practice of allowing a crowd hover- 
ing around him or behind screens while meeting people. Nehru nor- 
mally did not like to have any member of his staff to hang around 
while giving interview to people because he did not wish to inhibit his 
interviewers. I can recollect only one instance of a security official 
being present at a Nehru- interview. Nehru needlessly decided to give 
an interview to a man well-known for his criminal propensities. I for- 
get his name. 1 asked K.F. Rustomji, DIG, CID, in the Intelligence 
Bureau to be present at the interview with this unpredictable and irres- 
ponsible character. I had earlier told Nehru that I had asked Rustomji 
to be present. 

No security officials accompanied Nehru on his foreign tours for 
the simple reason that they would not be of any particular use. Nei- 
ther was the barbarous practice of hijacking planes prevelant then. 

The most embarrassing moments of foreign tours were in New York 
which normally is a place where every one is in an insane hurry and 
is running around like chicken with their heads cut off. In the medley 
of never-ending traffic, screechers blovv their sirens to clear traffic for 
the passage of the motor-cades of foreign dignitaries who are invited 
guests. On the sound of the sirens, cars on the roads have to move side- 
ways to clear the way so that the VIP motor-cades can speed their way 
breaking all traffic rules. It is not pleasant to see the annoyed faces of 
the New Y orkers in their cars nor to hear all the four-letter words and 
other words of abuse hurled at the VIPs. I happen to know a young 
New Y ork girl several times a multi-millionaries and the only child of 
multi-multi-mUIionairess widow. Neither the mother nor the daughter 
kept cars because of parking problems. They always used taxis whose 
drivers were known to them personally. 

The intelligence Bureau was worried about too many Muslim ser- 
vants in the government hospitality organization running the Prime

Minister’s House. Tiiey were subjected to strict investigations. As a 
result, the Intelligence wanted several of them to be transferred from 
the Prime Minister’s House. When I looked into the matter, it was 
found that the reason in almost all the cases was that some of their 
near relatives had migrated to Pakistan. I told the Intelligence people 
that they did not migrate on their own but were driven out, and added 
that the Prime Minister would be safer with the Muslim servants than 
with the non- Muslims. I asked them “was it a Muslim who killed 
Mahatma Gandhi?” There was no answer. I said “all the Muslim ser- 
vants will stay.” I mentioned the matter to the Prime Minister who 
approved. 

In India Nehru travelled mostly by air because: He wanted to save 
time; He wanted to do some reading and paper work in the aircraft; 
He liked air travel; Above all he wanted to avoid the embarrassingly 
elaborate and clumsy security arrangements. 

The elaborate arrangements for public meetings were clumsy. Far 
too many security personnel were used. The inner cordon was filled by 
plain-clothed policemen. The arrangements were needlessly expensive. 
But it must be said in defence of the Intelligence and the police that 
Nehru was not an easy person to manage from the security point of 
view. He would often break through police arrangemenis. Moreover, 
wherever he went, Nehru created commotions. There was always the 
popular upsurge. I had always felt that Nehru’s safety did not lie with 
the police but was in the keeping of fate and destiny. 

For some time in the early years of oflSce Nehru’s driver was Des 
Raj from the North-West Frontier. He was the man who drove Nehru 
and Dr Khan Sahib on the Frontier tour during which the tribals fired 
at Nehru and party at Malakand. Des Raj showed cool courage in the 
crisis. After partition he and his family migrated to India. He came 
to see me in Nehru’s house at 17, York Road in New Delhi. I had no 
hesitation in employing him straight away and putting him on Nehru’s 
duty. After a year, Des Raj had to be put on duty for guests. So a man 
called Rana Singh, a Gharwali, working in some government depart- 
mant, was brought in as Nehru’s driver. Soon special investigation on 
him started. After about a year the Intelligence Bureau reported that 
Rana Singh was an army deserter and recommended his dismissal from 
government service. A reference to the Army Headquarters revealed 
that Rank Singh deserted in 1942 soon after the “Quit India” move- 
ment was launched. The matter was mentioned to Nehru who would, 
on no account, agree to Rana Singh’s dismissal from service more 
especially because he was already in government service before being 
' transferred to the Prime Minister’s Secretariat. I asked the Intelligence 



Nehru and Security Arrangements 


135 


people if Rana Singh was a security risk. They said that, since Rana 
Singh was an army deserter, it was reasonable to presume that he was 
an unreliable person. I agreed that unreliability and security would go 
ill together. So Rana Singh was quietly transferred after ensuring that 
no further action would be taken against him. 

On 12 March 1955 rickshaw-puller Baburao Laxman Kohali, who 
was some sort of a political thinker, made an attempt on Nehru’s life 
with a knife in Nagpur. Baburao Laxman Kohali was ofthe firm view 
that “the Congress government was ruling by majority and hence was 
lacking in wisdom.” He was exercised over this and wanted to remove 
the root cause of the Congress majority. The District and Sessions 
Judge of Nagpur, on 28 July 1955 sentenced the “political thinker” 
to undergo six years’ rigorous imprisonment under Section 307, Indian 
Penal Code, for “attempting to cause the death of Prime Minister 
Nehru on 12 March 1955.” 

One morning in 1958 Nehru, who was in a good mood at breakfast, 
told me that he was unlikely to live beyond 74 years of age. I com- 
mented “you must have been listening to Punya Dev Sharraa too 
much.” He said he had calculated it all by himself by taking the aver- 
age of lives of males in the family. Punya Dev Sharma was a good old 
social worker of the Punjab and a keen student of astrology. Provi- 
dence preserved Nehru who died after completing 74 years, 6 months, 
and 13 days. 



18 Agriculture and Community Development 


Ever since the Bengal famine in the early forties, the food situation in 
India had been precarious till 1972. The Interim Government, which 
came into being on 2 September 19.46 was sadd ed with a serious food 
situation. Nehru made frantic elforts to get foodgrains from Indo- 
nesia, Thailand, Burma and from wherever possible. The large 
Sterling balance had to be frittered away mostly on food imports. 
Even though the deficit in India’s food requirements was only -0 per 
cent of the country’s total production, from 1946 to 1972 we had to 
import 93,247,000 tons of foodgrains valued at Rs 4,827 crores 
(Rs 4,827,58,00,000 C &amp; F to be exact). The largest imports were in 
1966 and 1967 as indicated below: 

Quanta V Cost C &amp; F 

1966 10,358,000 Tons Rs 523,13,00,000 

1967 8,672,000 Tons ^ 532,16,00,000 

Nehru was naturally worried about the severe strain caused by 
continuous foodgrain imports. He made innumerable radio broad- 
casts on the subject, and more than once hinted at stoppage of 
imports. But his choice of Food and Agriculture Ministers was far 
frorn happy. Rajendra Prasad was more interested in pinjarapoles 
(cow ashrams) than anything else. Jairamdas Daulatram, who rightly 
belonged to a pinjarapole, was wrongly appointed Minister of Food 
and Agriculture. Rafi Ahmed Kidwai was lucky in the short term, 
but circumstances conspired against him in the matter of finding a 
lasting solution. K.M. Munshi and Ajit Prasad Jain were birds of 
passage. Nehru further complicated the situation by bringing in a 
man as Food Production Commissioner in the Food and Agriculture 
Ministry daring the tenure of Jairamdas Daulatram, thus creating a 
fifth wheel in the coach. This experiment had to be given up. 

Like a drowning man clutching at a straw, Nehru found a ray of 
hope in Lala Shri Ram, a self-made old recluse, who preached a new 
gospel: “concentrate on subsidiary foods like sweet potato and change 
people’s food habits.” Nehru took up the gospel which he tried to 
popularise by making more radio broadcasts. 



Agriculiure and Community Development 137 

Lala Sir Shri Ram was a successful businessman who built up the 
DCM Group of industries, handed over the enterprise to his sons and 
nephews, and adopted the life of a hermit. I once asked the old man 
how he proposed to change the age-old food habits of the people. 
He made a long speech during which he pointed out that Indians ate 
more cereals than any other people in the world. That must change, 
he said, and added, “Look at the Chinese and the Japanese. They 
have no inhibitions about eating almost anything. Their intalce of 
cereals is limited because they eat subsidiary foods.” I told him that 
much of their subsidiary foods comprised beef, ham and pork, other 
meat, fish and such things as snakes, snails, rats, frogs, crabs, tortoi- 
ses, whales, sharks, sea-weeds and innumerable other items which 
Indians would shun. I suggested that he might become the President 
of the Beef and Ham Club of India — a position K.M. Panikkar held 
and was now vacant on Panikkar’s departue from India as Ambassa- 
dor to China. I told him that Swami Vivekananda,. Vinoba Bhave, 
Suniti Kumar Chatterji, K.M. Munshi and Avinash Chandra held the 
view that in Vedic times Hindus consumed beef; the learned scholar 
Raja Rajendralal Mittra had written a chapter “Beef in Ancient 
India” in his highly esteemed book Indo- Aryans,” and the author had 
quoted copiously from scriptures to show that beef was not only eaten 
but considered a delicacy. 

I suggested to the old man that in his mission to propagate subsi- 
diary foods, he might include in the list not only sweet potato but all 
the items which the Chinese and the Japanese ate. I told him that 
thereby he would be doing a great service to the country and help in 
improving the cattle population in the process by considerable reduc- 
tion in numbers. He frankly admitted that cows were looked after well 
and treated humanely in beef-eating countries while in India, where 
we shouted “Gow Mata,” they were terribly famished and treated with 
cruelly. He also said that it was a shame that India, with the largest 
cattle population in the world, had the lowest yield of milk, and milk 
powder had to be imported from beef-eating countries. Like most 
Lalas, however, he felt that if he openly aired his views, he would 
have to face hostile demonstrations by obscurantists. 

A new set-up for subsidiary foods was created in the Ministry of 
Food and Agriculture and Lala Shri Ram became the Honorary 
Adviser. It too ended up as a futility. 

Nehru realised very early and clearly that even for improvement 
of agriculture and rural development, it was absolutely essential to 
develop basic industries. Hence his emphasis on industrial develop- 
ment. For example it was the development of oil industry that helped 



138 


My Days with Nehru 


to produce fertilisers on a large scale. Electricity, railways, all kinds 
of transport industries, engineering industries, coal and metallurgical 
industries, and even aircraft industry, nuclear research and space 
research are important for agriculture and rural development. Agri- 
culture and industry have become terribly inter-dependent. Neither 
can grow without the other. One can trace a cotton seed, an oil seed, 
a sugarcane sapling or a jute sapling step by step to heavy industry. 

Nehru also realised that India, with its size and geographical 
position, should rapidly extricate itself from undue dependence on 
foreign countries and became self-reliant in the matter of defence 
equipment and supplies. This could never have been achieved without 
laying stress on basic heavy industries and creating an adequate indus- 
trial infra-structure. 

Charan Singh 

Jats are brave soldiers and excellent farmers, but poor politicians. 
Charan Singh is no exception. As a Minister and Chief Minister of 
UP, Charan Singh had a great deal to do with agriculture and allied 
subjects. 

' At a meeting in Mussoorie in the early fifties in connection with 
Community Development Programme, Nehru spoke at length about 
the food situation in the country. His main theme was that the deficit 
in food production was only 10 per cent of India’s requirements and 
this could be made up if an all-out elfort was made. He emphasised 
the importance of compost manure and other improvizations. Nehru 
implied that state governments were not enterprising enough. Charan 
Singh spoke frankly without fear of displeasing Nehru. He said that 
food production could not be increased without substantial addition 
of inputs which meant considerable additional outlay in terms of 
funds. He added that the practice of making compost manure came 
to us from the time of Rama and Sita and that there was hardly any 
scope for making more in agriculture areas. 

At Nagpur Charan Singh opposed the Congress Resolution of Co- 
operative and Joint farming. Most people at the session were aware 
that the Indian'peasantry was so conservative that it was impossible 
to implement that resolution. It has all along remained on paper. 
Land reforms were never implemented honestly except in Kerala and 
Kashmir. Charan Singh’s own state, Uttar Pradesh, is perhaps the 
worst in this matter, which is an indication that Charan Singh is 
biased in favour of the relatively well-to-do farmers. 



Agriculture and Community Development 


139 


Charan Singh’s economic ideas seem to be astoundingly antedilu- 
vian. Only an enemy of agriculture and rural development in the 
modern age will advocate abolition of heavy and big industry. Allo- 
cation of more funds for agriculture and rural development is a different 
matter. Poor farmers and landless agricultural labourers do not seem 
to enter into Charan Singh’s thinking. Rightly or wrongly Charan 
Singh has created an impression that he is anti-Harijan. This is a 
matter of serious consequence for a politician of Charan Singh’s 
standing. The Kissan Sammelan, which Charan Singh’s uncertain 
follower Raj Narain has organized, seems to be a forum for the 
relatively well-to-do farmers. 

Gandhi would have taken us to mythical Rama Rajya whatever 
that might mean. But, left to himself, Charan Singh, with his incura- 
ble primitive outlook, would love to make cave-men of us all. 

When Charan Singh broke away from the Congress and managed 
to become the Chief Minister of UP someone told me that Charan 
Singh was the number one defector in history. I contradicted him and 
said that the number one defector was Angel Gabriel and Charan 
Singh was only a close second. Angel Gabriel was very close to Adam 
and to the Patriarch of the Jews — Abraham. Prophet Mohammed 
received his first revelation through Angel Gabriel in 609 A.D. In 630 
A.D. Mohammed conquered Mecca. Then the House of God (Jeho- 
vah), said to have been originally built by Adam and reconstructed by 
Abraham around 2,000 B.C., was restored to Allah. 

It would have been amusing to see Charan Singh piloting the con- 
troversial anti-defection Bill in Parliament. I wonder if Parliament 
would have been successful in defining defection precisely. The United 
Nations General Assembly tried for years to’ define aggression, and 
went on postponing it. During the prolonged discussion only a Latin 
American delegate spoke sense. He said “Gentlemen, aggression is 
like a beautiful woman. When she enters a drawing room, we gasp. 
It is impossible to describe her; but we know she is there. She will 
remain eternally indefinable.” If Charan Singh succeeded in getting 
the anti-defection Bill through Parliament, his achievement would 
have ranked with that of Jean Jacques Rousseau in a different field. 
Because of his poverty, Rousseau left his numerous children, soon 
after they were born, one after the other in a basket in front of the 
gate of a convent in Paris to be looked after as orphans by the nuns. 
Later he wrote a book “On the Care and Upbringing of Children 
which was so brilliant that it remains a French classic of its kind 
even today. Rousseau believed in the theory it is not necessary to be 
a cook to enjoy good food. 



140 


My Days with Nehru 


It might be mentioned that two of the greatest Prime Ministers of 
Great Britain would, according to the Indian attempt at definition, be 
dubbed as defectors. Gladstone, popularly known as the Grand Old 
Man, started his political career as a Tory and later switched over to 
the Liberal Party. He retired as the Liberal Prime Minister at the 
age of 85— a record Morarji Desai is trying to equal if not surpass. 
Winston Churchill started his political life as a Tory, crossed the 
floor over to the Opposition, and latter returned to the fold— which 
prompted Clement Attlee to make the onlv quotable quip in his life 
“it is the. only instance, in history, of a rat returning to a sinking 
ship.” I should not be unfair to Attlee. He coined the undying phrase 
“wars begin in the minds of men” in the inspiring preamble to the 
UNESCO charter.” 

India has unutilized more agricultural potential in terms of land, 
water, sun and energy than any other country of its size. Its cropped 
land is 140 million hectares — the same as in the United States. It’s 
area under irrigation is larger than that of China, but the potential 
for extending irrigation is even higher. In 1950 the area under irriga- 
tion in India was 21.65 million hectares. By the time the Janata party 
came to power in 1977, the irrigated area was more than double. 
Apart from this, the rate of accrual potential on major and medium 
irrigation schemes already undertaken has been 1.47 million hectares 
per year. 

In 1952-53 the production of nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers 
in India was a mere 60,505 metric tons. By the time the Janata party 
came into power in 1977 the annual production of these fertilisers 
had crossed the two million metric ton mark. If the capacity of on- 
going fertiliser factories Mere to be added, India was on the sure 
road to self-sufficiency in fertilisers. 

Foodgrains (including pulses) production increased from 63.18 
’million on metric tons in 1951 to 121.03 million metric tons before 
the Janata came to power. Oil seeds production increased during the 
same period from 5.52 million metric tons to 9.91 million metric 
tons and sugarcane (in terms of gur) production rose during the 
same period from 5.4 million metric tons to 15.84 million metric 
tons. 

Cotton production during the same period rose from 3.66 million 
bales to 5.78 million bales while jute and mesta production during 
the same period rose from 4.78 million bales to 7.09 million bales. ' 

The population of India, which was 361 million in 1951 rose to 625 
million by the time the Janata came to power in 1977. This gives an 
indication of the crushing burden the planners had to contend with. 



Agriculture and Community Development 


141 


During the Second World War, Nehru happened to come across 
one Albert Meyer, an American engineer, who was greatly interested 
in improving village life in India. He advocated changes without 
destroying the desirable aspects of Indian traditions. Soon after his 
release from prison in 1945 Nehru spoke to Pandit Govind Ballabh 
Pant and said he would like Albert Meyer to be gi^ en an opportunity 
to start his experiment as a pilot project in UP. He put Albert Meyer 
in touch with Pant. After Pant resumed office as Chief Minister, 
Albert Meyer, in consultation with Pant, chose Etah as the location 
for his project. Nehru took keen interest in Meyer’s work and gave 
him all the encouragement. Nehru looked upon this experiment as a 
prelude to something big which was to be launched for the benefit of 
villagers among whom started his political career and whom he never 
forgot. 

S.K. Dey 

S.K; Dey, who hails from Sylhet (now in Bangladesh), is an 
engineer by training who took his engineering degree in the United 
States. At the time of partition he was having a lucrative position in 
Bombay. He was deeply moved by the largest migration in human 
history which took place in northern India and the miseries wrought 
in its wake. With hardly any thought for his wife and four small 
children, Dey resigned and came to Delhi. After a talk with K.C. 
Neogy, Minister for Rehabilitation, Dey headed for Kurukshetra 
where large numbers of refugees were living in temporary camps 
under insanitary conditions. He harangued the refugees about the 
shame of living on doles and asked for volunteers, who had faith 
in themselves and in the future, to march with him to the unknown. 
Ihe response was more than Dey expected. He marched with a large 
number to a place called Nilokheri. There all able-bodied men and 
women were provided with work to build a township for themselves. 
Dey’s slogan was “muscles can do it.” He established foundries, 
workshops and industrial training centres and helped in starting small- 
scale industries. The refugees were allotted agriculturaJ land accord- 
ing to their entitlements. Nilokheri soon became a symbol of hard 
work lifting people above abject dependence on doles and charity, as 
well as the triumph of robust faith over karmic fatalism or kismet. 

When the sharpness of the refugee problem was blunted, Nehru 
revived his interest in the community development programme started 
as an experiment in Etah by Albert Meyer. He wanted to combine it 
with certain aspects of S.K. Dey’s work in Nilokheri. He knew it

My Days with Nehru 


was a programme to be implemented by the states, but he wanted 
central direction and coordination to be available to the states to 
bring about some uniformity. While he was considering several names 
for a suitable person to be put in charge of the programme at the 
centre, I suggested S.K. Dey. Nehru liked Dey’s enthusiasm and 
dedication. However, he asked me “will he get along with officials?” 
I told him that if he considered S.K, Dey as a suitable person for the 
job, then it was for the officials to get along with him. Ultimately 
Nehru created the Department of Community Development and put 
S.K. Dey in charge as Administrator. Dey worked on one-rupee-a-year 
“salary” but he was given a free furnished house with free electricity 
and water supply, and a chauffeur-driven car. 

Dey did not spare himself and worked with demonical energy. 
Nehru lent him all the support he needed. 

Soon after S.K. Dey’s appointment was announced, the late P.T. 
Punnoose, a communist MP from Kerala, raised an angry protest in 
Parliament for appointing an American to the post. Punnoose 
was new to northern India and did not know that Dey was a Bengali. 

The Community Development Blocks were started as an ideal area 
development multi-purpose package programme. In course of time, 
rather too soon, the programme was severely diluted to meet political 
demands to cover the entire country without adequate resources in 
money, trained manpower, and inputs required for production. Con- 
sequently the great hopes generated among people could not be ful- 
filled. This resulted in great disappointment. Coordination by the 
Block Development Officer became difficult beacuse the various 
departments at state government headquarters wanted to exercise 
direct control of their Block-level staff. 

The National Extension Service, however, has come to stay. It has 
greatly contributed to the increased agricultural production. The 
NES has been effective not only in the field of agriculture, but also 
in animal husbandry and minor irrigation. The Block is viable as a 
unit of planning insofar as it relates to agriculture, animal husbandry 
and allied subjects as well as in social services, but not where industrial 
development is concerned. 

In the mid-fifties S.K. Dey told me privately that he had come to 
the end of his financial resources, but still did not wish to become a 
government servant on a regular salary basis. I mentioned this matter 
'to the Prime Minister and said that the only solution was to make 
S.K. Dey a Minister. Nehru did not hestiate to appoint him as a 
Minister of State and asked him to continue his work. Subsequently 
he was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Delhi.

143 


Panchayatiraj is an offshoot of the community development pro- 
gramme. Nehru realised that many mistakes would be committed in 
the early stages of Panchayatiraj. He said “let them make a million 
mistakes; that is the only way .to learn.” When he spoke of “mistakes” 
he meant “honest mistakes.” Panchayatiraj did not work satisfacto- 
rily except for a limited extent in Gujarat and Maharashtra. The 
reasons were: (1) Lack of political will. The state government did 
not want to decentralize power to the Panchayatiraj institutions. (2) 
Panchayatiraj institutions did not fail to misuse power. Dishonesty 
and corruption became widespread. It is the age-old principle “an in- 
stitution will rise or fall to the level of the people who work it.” 

S.K. Dey successfully contested election to the Lok Sabha in the 
1961/62 general elections. After Nehru’s death the Community Deve- 
lopment Ministry w'as tagged on to the Ministry of Food and Agri- 
culture, and S.K. Dey was appointed Minister of State in independent 
charge of Mines and Metals. In the 1966/67 general elections contri- 
ved to deny Dey the Congress ticket for re-election to the Lok Sabha. 

The committee comprising Asoka Mehta, E.M.S. Namboodiripad 
and S.K. Dey, among others, who reviewed the Panchayatiraj system, 
has reiterated its faith, in it and has made some valuable suggestions. 

As of 31 March 1977 there were 5,028 Community Development 
Blocks in the country covering 390 Districts. The total Block-level 
staff was 1,15,491 as detailed below; 


Block Development Officers 4,777 

Gram Sevaks 65,450 

Extension Officers (Agriculture) 6,096 

Extension Officers (Animal Husbandry) 5,046 

Extension Officers (Industry) 695 

Extension Officers (Cooperation) 4,208 

Extension Officers (Education) 1,810 

Extension Officers (Panchayats) 4,435 

Gram Sevikas 6,004 

Mukhya Sevikas 1,527 

Overseers 4,961 

Progress Assistants 2;765 

Medical Officers 7,717 


Average C.D. Block staff strength per District is 296. 

Thus the Janata government inherited the infrastructure necessary 
for rapid rural development. 

Early in 1959 the late Dr Boshi Sen, the agricultural scientist of 



144 


My Days with Nehru 


Almora and an early collaborator of the illustrious Sir Jagdish 
Chandra Bose, received a communication from Prime Minister Nehru 
asking if he could help in starting an agricultural pilot project in the 
bleak and inhospitable Ladakh,- popularly known as the “High 
Altitude Desert” on an experimental basis. I was then staying in 
Dr Boshi Sen’s house, having resigned from the government. Dr Sen 
was the first man, in India to hybridise maize (corn). He consulted 
me on Nehru’s letter. On my advice he informed the Prime Minister 
that he would be happy to undertake the task provided it was under 
the auspices of the army because it was known that most civilian 
departments were slow-moving and wooden and their “grow more 
food” was all on files. The army accepted it and Dr Sen sent one of 
his best young men to Leh in Ladakh to organize the project. He him- 
self could not go as the doctors prohibited him from going to that 
height at his advanced age. 

Having ascertained that 96 per cent of the area in Ladakh was 
barren. Dr Sen asked his man in Ladakh to concentrate on experi- 
ments in growing wheat, barley, vegetables and fodder. He laid stress 
on fodder as that would eventually help in livestock development. 

Ladakh has now over 45,000 acres of land under agriculture. All 
these are irrigated by local technique. Modern irrigation facilities are 
now being extended there. It was Dr Sen who first grew wheat in 
Ladakh in the early sixties. Now wheat is grown over an area of 9,328 
acres. With an improved varietry, which is rust-resistant, the yield 
is as much as 13 quintals per acre maturing in 135 days — which excels 
the dwarf varieties which have revolutionized wheat cultivation in, 
the plains. 

Remarkable improvement has taken place in the cultivation of 
bailey which has been the staple food of the people of Ladakh for 
ages. A new disease-resistant variety maturing in 90 days and 
yielding as much as 16 quintals per acre is now under cultivation. 
Ladakh has now 26,429 acres of land under barley. 

Vegetables are also grown on a fairly large scale. In the mid-sixties 
Dr Sen showed me an incredible monstefsize potato grown by his 
man in Ladakh. 

As a result of experiments at the agriculture farm at Leh in 
Ladakh, the European variety of lucerne grass proved to yield six 
times more than Ladakh alfalfa and mature in four months and yield 
three crops of hay. The gross income from an acre could be Rs 6,500 
per year compared to Rs 1,000 from local varieties. At present fodder 
is grown in a area covering 9,165 acres. In the eastern parts, where 



Agriculture and Community Development 145 

the 'winter is harsh and summer short, a variety of oats from Finland 
was tried in 1975-76 and found promising. 

Considerable progress has been made in agriculture in the lower 
altitude of Ladakh — 9,000 feet to 10,500 feet. It has been discovered 
that two crops are possible in this area. Government has schemes to 
bring the vast culturable waste lands in Ladakh under cultivation and 
under perennial pastures by providing irrigation facilities. 

Five years before the Janata came to power, India had suceeded in 
shaking off the terrible burden of the stigma as a nation with a 
begging bowl. 

It has become a fashion for many in the Janata party to say that 
the Congress did precious little in 30 years for the benefit of the 
people. When even men like Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, Jagjivan 
Ram, Biju Patnaik and some of the Janata party Chief Ministers, who 
were prominent Congressmen and important Congress ministers, join 
this absurd chorus in varying degrees, the people have every right to 
doubt their capacity to do any good now or in the future. Those who 
harp on the past and arc not obsessed with the present are cowardly 
dcmogogucs who will lose the future. 

The Janata government formed early in 1977 inherited tremendous 
assets from its predecessor in terms of: 

(1) Unprecedented surplus foodgrain stocks. 

(2) Comfortable foreign exchange reserves. 

(3) Near self-sufficiency in fertiliser production. 

(4) An-expending irrigation system. 

(5) Great strides in scientific research including outstanding results 
achieved by the Indian Council for Agricultural Research and its 
affiliates as well as by the Agricultural Universities. 

(6) An infra-structure relating to Community Development, 
National Extension Service and Panchayatiraj. 

(7) A rapidly growing wide industrial base. 

(8) A vast scientific and technical manpower — the third largest in 
the world. 

All these are the fruits of the labours of Jawaharlal Nehru in 
laying the sure foundations for a self -generating and self-reliant eco- 
nomy. These, cannot be reversed no matter what people like Charan 
Singh might wish. 

With further rapid e.xtension of irrigation potential, India is 
destined to be free from the vagaries of the weather gods to a large 
extent and emerge as one of the largest producers of agricultural 
commodities in the world. The planners in India will do well to give 
early thought to the paradox of starvation amidst plenty. The alter- 



146

native will be violent revolution. People will no longer be willing to 
fall dead without protest, as they did so pathetically during the Bengal 
famine early in the forties, especially when they are aware that our 
warehouses are bulging with food. 

It is a great pity that the principal casuality of the emergency has 
been the Family Planning programme. Unless the Janata government 
shakes off its pusillanimity and gives a mighty push to this programme, 
which is a compelling necessity, all the benefits of planning will be 
gobbled up by the population explosion. Adding an “Australia” 
every year to our population is the surest way to condemn the present 
and future generations to eternal poverty and want. 


19 Some Disjointed Facts 


In my first book I have written about Nehru’s sensitivity to his surround- 
ings. When Nehru visited Czechoslovakia in 1938, accompanied by 
Indira, A.C.N. Nambiar was with him. In fact Nambiar was living in 
Czechoslovakia then, and he knew the Czech language fairly well. In 
the train to Prague, Nehru, Indira and Nambiar occupied the corner 
of a compartment with two chairs on either side and a table in the 
middle. A group of four Czech MPs were also in the compartment. 
One of them went to Nambiar, whispered something and returned to 
his seat. Nehru asked Nambiar what the man said. Nanibiar-told him 
“he and his fellow MPs wanted to exchange places with us.” Nehru 
asked “What did you tell him?” Nambiar said “I told them no.” Nehru 
was visibly annoyed and told Nambiar “can’t you see that they are 
terribly exercised over the situation in the country and they want to sit 
in a quiet corner and discuss important matters? Go and tell them that 
they can move over here.” Nambiar said “I shall tell them; but I am 
under no illusion that these fellows are tormented by extreme anxiety 
and patriotic fervour.” Soon after the four MPs were seated comfor- 
'tably, they started a game of Bridge! Nehru looked at Nambiar in 
some embarrassment and smiled. 

Having been used to an atmosphere of Hindustani (a mixture of 
Hindi and Urdu), Nehru disapproved of any attempt at artificially 
Sanskritizing Hindi. He was also annoyed by the shiidh Hindi employ- 
ed by All India Radio. The fact that even in those places in the north, 
where Muslims were numerically insignificant, the language was 
different from that in Lucknow and Allahabad did not register much 
with Nehru. I orce told him that, while artificial twist to any language 
was unhealthy, when the south woke up to Hindi, the language that 
would emerge would be highly sanskrilized; even the Muslims of 
Kerala did not know a word of Urdu; and that eventual Sanskritiza- 
tion and progressive use of words from the so-called Dravidian 
languages in Hindi would be a natural development. 

Because of his family tradition and background, in Nehru’s think- 
ing “minorities” meant mostly Muslims. There would, of course, never 
exist a government at the centre without Muslims in the cabinet. A 
Sikh has always found a seat in the central cabinet, but not a Christian 



148 


My Days with Nehru 


even though the Christians constitute the second largest minority in 
India next only to the Muslims. For example there was no Christian 
in the union cabinet for 20 years— 1957 to 1977. A prominent Sikh 
leader once told me that unless the Christians carry kirpans, they would 
be ignored. He added “look at the Scheduled Castes and Tribes; des- 
pite Gandhi and the Constitution, their lot remains very much a part 
of our so-called ancient culture and the mythical Rama Rajya. There 
is a deep-rooted sense of equality among the Muslims. I can think 
of nothing more exclusive than Hindu society which indulges in self- 
deception by double thinking. Perhaps the position of the scheduled 
castes and tribes will alter radically only as a result of a violent 
change.” 

In my first book I have referred to Shiv Dutt Upadhya and Hari 
La). Upadhyaya, now in his 80th year and in indifferent health, 
joined Motilal Nehru as a young man and continued with Jawaharlal 
Nehru. He was not of much use in the modern secretarial sense; but 
he had other desirable qualities. Hari also served Motilal Nehru 
and continued with Nehru as his valet till the end of his days about 
four years before Nehru’s death. Hari was a Harijan. Before indepen- 
dence he was for a term an MLA in UP. That was the period when 
Nehru said that people would vote for Congress even if a lamp post 
was put up as a candidate. Hari created a minor sensation in London 
when, on my insistence, Nehru took him there on one of his visits. 
Hari’s photograph appeared in several English newspapers with the 
caption “Jeeves in London.” I arranged with a Hindi-speaking em- 
ployee of India House to take Hari round and show him the sights 
of London. On the eve of our departure from London, Hari told me 
that he never wanted to visit England again. I asked him why. He 
hesitated and finally told me, in strict confidence, of what he saw in 
Hyde Park in broad daylight. He asked me not to tell any one. So I 
shall not write about it! 

Nehru’s treatment of these old employees left much to be desired. 
■ In my first book I have mentioned how, by my intervention, the lapse 
was redressed somewhat. When Nehru entered the Interim government 
in 1946 Upadhyaya shared a cottage with Dwarak Nath Kachru in 
the grounds of 17 York Road, where Nehru lived. Upadhyaya and 
Kachru never got on well. Upadhyaya and Hari were never in the 
good books of Nehru’s two sisters. Neither of them was prepared to 
be doormats to the two sisters who possessed the unfortunate oriental 
habit of treating household employees as personal serfs. Upadhyaya 
is one year older than Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. 

Vijaya Lakshmi repeatedly spoke to Nehru and impressed on him

that Upadhyaya would not fit into the new scheme of things and that 
he would be more of an embarrassment than help. She suggested that 
Upadhyaya and family should be sent away to Allahabad to look after 
Anand Bhawan. Nehru hesitated. After some time Indira also lent 
support to what Vijay Lakshmi had said. Ultimately Nehru suggested 
to Upadhyaya that he might shift to Allahabad with his family. He 
went with extreme reluctance and with a heavy heart. The snapping of 
the long association was too much for Upadhyaya. He felt unhappy 
and miserable in Allahabad and, without Nehru’s knowledge or per- 
mission, returned to Delhi. He arranged with a Congress MP to share 
his accommodation and then brought his family from Allahabad. He 
had to pay rent to the MP who, like many of his kind, took it even 
though it was illegal to do so. 

Nehru himself was feeling rather unhappy at sending away 
Upadhyaya. He felt that the ordinary run of Congressmen were mis- 
sing the familiar face of Upadhyaya whenever they came to Nehru’s 
house. But Nehru did not enquire about where he was staying in Delhi 
and how he was making both ends meet. Some of Upadhyaya’s perso- 
nal friends helped him during this diflcicult period. What Nehru gave 
Upadhyaya was not adequate for him and his family to live in Delhi 
even modestly. 

Soon after Rajaji assumed office as Governor-General on 21 June 
1948, I spoke to him and he was good enough to allot Upadhyaya 
rent-free quarters in the Governor-General’s estate. When Upadhyaya 
became a Member of Parliament, he was charged a nominal rent to 
fulfill the requirements of law. He still lives in the same quarters. In 
1951 Upadhyaya spoke to me about his financial problems. In spite 
of help from friends during the past four years, he had piled up a debt 
of about Rs 10,000. 1 raised that amount for him and put him out of 
his misery. 

Nehru’s non-career adhoc Private Secretary, DwarakaNathKachru, 
was a person who had never learn’t the value of money except his own. 
And he loved the telephone too much. In the first three months of 
office, September to November 1947, Kachru ran a bill of Rs 7,000 
on long-distance telephone calls. The official in charges of adminis- 
tration brought this to the attention of the Prime Minister who, natu- 
rally, became furious and wanted to see Kachru immediately. How- 
ever, I rang up Kachru and asked him to make himself scarce for two 
days in order to give time to Nehru to cool down. At last Kachru came 
and received a dressing down. In a feeble attempt to defend himself 
Kachru advanced a new economic theory that actually there was no 
expenditure as the money paid would go to the Post and Telegraph 



150 


My Days with Nehru 


Department of the government. Nehru said “then you pay to the Post 
and Telegraph Department and see if the no -expenditure hurts.” 
Kachru went about unsuccessfully to raise a loan. After a week I told 
Kachru “provided you have learn’t a lesson, you might abandon the 
futile chase to find a creditor. No one will lend to a man who has no 
credit-worthiness.” Ultimately, in the interest of propriety, Nehru paid 
the bill and prohibited Kachru from making trunk calls in future with- 
out his permission. 

Nehru was particular that he should not spent money lavishly on 
himself. He would go on darning his old clothes including cotton 
Khadi kurtas and churidar pyjamas. Whenever he left a room he would 
put off the fan and lights himself instead of leaving it to the servants. 
When an old overcoat belonging to his father became totally unservi- 
ceable, Nehru turned down a proposal to buy an overcoat in London. 
Instead he bought some rough woollen material from the Khadi 
Bhandar and his tailor Mohammad Umar made the coat. I never dis- 
covered what D.P. Mishra was quick in discovering that “Nehru was 
extremely fond of European dress.” It is true that until the mid-fifties 
he wore European clothes whenever he went to western countries. The 
reason was that he did not want to appear different and attract atten- 
tion. Even during this period he wore Indian dress for formal occasions. 
From the mid-fifties onwards he wore only Indian clothes. During his 
last visit to Canada in winter in 1962, while I was no longer with him 
and he was in failing health, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit was worried and 
asked me to have a look at his wardrobe. I went to the Prime Minister’s 
House with some useful items of winter clothing packed in a box. While 
Vijaya Lakshmi and I were examining Nehru’s clothes which were 
spread on his bed, Nehru came and asked “what is going on here.” 
Vijays Lakshmi said “I asked Mac to come and have a look; so he is 
here.” I showed Nehru some soft woollen vests which I had never used. 
He took two. Then I showed him some long tight-fitting under-pants 
made of the finest Egyptian- cotton, also not used before. He took three. 
Then, with considerable diffidence, I showed him my fur-lined over- 
coat. Surprisingly, he tried it and told me that it was too heavy and 
asked me to take it back. 

Nehru’s tailor Mohammad Umar, an old man, was a character. He 
was introduced to me by Raghunandan Saran whom Nehru knew very 
well. Umar’s shop in New Delhi was looted during the partition up- 
heaval, but his old Delhi shop escaped a similar fate. One of his sons 
had to flee to Pakistan. Umar made some clothes for me — a job well 
done. From then on only Mohammad Umar made clothes for Nehru, 
We got Umar’s New Delhi shop restored to him. Soon Umar entered 


1

the flourishing stage of his career. He advertised himself as “Tailor to 
the Prime Minister.” His son in Karachi advertised himself as “former 
tailor to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.” I asked Umar whether use of 
Nehru’s name in Karachi-helped. He replied in his inimitable English 
“Sahib, Panditji is best-seller anywhere. My son is already one of the 
leading tailors in Karachi. He has more work than he can do.” 

As he was ever anxious to observe financial prosprieties, Nehru was 
particular that no hoarding to anything should be resorted to in his 
house more especially during times of scarcity and rationing. Before 
I left him in 1959 1 gave him a good number of his favourite long black 
utility type “Zeus” cigaratte holders which were no longer available in 
India. He looked at me and asked “don’t you know that I don’t hoard?.” 
I said that they were no longer available in India and that, in any event, 
they were not an essential consumer item. He took four and returned 
the rest to me saying “one can always stop using them when they are 
not available. I will feel uncomfortable if I store anything for the future. 
However, he did not have to, for I kept them for him and replenished 
his stock in small numbers periodically. 

As in the case of elderly colleagues to whom he showed extra cour- 
tesy, Nehru showed respect to people in the mass. He would never 
smoke at a public meeting or in the presence of large numbers of 
people. He did, however, smoke at committee meetings. He was not 
a heavy smoker. He used the “Zeus” cigarette holder into which either 
a whole cigarette or cotton wool could bt- inserted to absorb a good 
part of the nicotine. Normally Nehru used cotton wool which was- 
changed about four times a day, and kept the empty cigarette holder 
in water with a few drops of dettol at night. When he felt he was smo- 
king too much, he would cut the cigarette into half to make the 
number last for the rest of the day so that the daily ration was not 
exceeded. 

Nehru did not care for air-conditioners. He did not use them in his 
bedroom or in his oflices in the Secretariat and Parliament. At night 
he preferred to sleep on the verandah. He once told me that he liked 
the smell of the earth. In summer, however, he used the air-conditio- 
ner in his study in the Prime Minister’s House where he worked till 
late at night. In the mid-fifties, as Nehru was getting older, I felt it 
was essential to provide an air-conditioner in his bedroom as a stand- 
by in case of illness. I decided to bypass him and had the airconditio- 
ner installed while he was abroad. On return from abroad he noticed 
the air-conditioner and atonce knew I was the culprit and told me that 
he did not want it. I said that it was there to be used only in certain 
contingencies and that normally he need not use, it. However, we used 



152 


My Days with Nehru 


to put on the air-conditioner every day during summer for two hours 
before he came for lunch. It was put off as soon as Nehru’s car was 
spotted at the gate. After lunch he would rest for some time in the bed- 
room which was kept cool for him; but th'e machine never worked 
while he was in the room. The air-conditioner served a particularly 
useful purpose during the last phase of his life, more especially the 
last month of his life— May 1964— which was as hot as an oven. 

People will still remember Nehru going about with an ivory-tipped 
sandalwood baton in his hand. He did so as an aid to combat his 
nervousness. He always wanted to grip something. He once told me 
that, if he did not have the baton with him, he would roll a handker- 
chief into a ball and grip it. 

Nehru was not a demonstrative person. One way of showing his 
affection for a person was to give him things he had used. At various 
times he had given me his “Eden” hat, a felt hat, a woollen beret cap, 
a silk shirt, his Harrow tie, shoes and chappals. I could not use the 
hats as they were one size smaller for my head. They were ultimately 
handed over to the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Museum on the eve 
of my departure from Delhi. The Harrow tie was stolen by someone. 

Few in India realise the variety of services rendered by our missions 
abroad. I shall give two examples. Ambassador N. Raghavan sent a 
secret code telegram from Brussels disclosing the name of a person 
travelling by air to Delhi, the name of the airline, the flight number, 
date and time of arrival at Palam airport, and an indication of what 
he was smuggling on his person. The ambassador recommended the 
administration of astiffdoes of castor oil to the smuggler at the airport. 
The ambassador’s suggestion was carried out by the customs authori- 
ties. It was incredible that the man could store so much precious stuff 
in that particular part of his anatomy. The smuggler confessed that 
for three days before his departure from Brussels he had starved and 
took only one glass of water on the plane. 

Ambassador K.M. Panikkar sent a secret telegram from Paris to 
say that two members of the Pakistan embassy had secretly offered to 
hand over Pakistan’s diplomatic code for a stiff piece which was spe- 
cified in the telegram. I delayed submission of the copy of the tele- 
gram to the Prime Minister and told the Foreign Secretary that, if a 
minister’s orders were required, he might take up the matter with Home 
Minister Pant; and that before a reply was sent to the ambassador, I 
might be informed. The Foreign Secretary cleared the matter quickly 
with Pant and showed me the draft reply to Panikkar to the effect that, 
if the ambassador was satisfied about the genuineness of the offer, the 
price asked for might be paid. I was taken aback and said that I would

MUST SHE HIDE HER FACE NOW ? The 
Shah Commission has held that the decision to 
proclaim internal Emergency on 26 June 1975 
was taken “exclusively” by Mrs Indira Gandhi 
in a desperate bid to continue in power despite 
the Allahabad High Court’s verdict against 
her. Describing Mr Sanjay Gandhi’s role as 
the “single greatest act of excess committed 
during the Emergency,” Mr Justice J.C. Shah 
Dbserved: “Here was a young man who literally 
imused himself with demoh'shing residential,

ealisation of the miseries he was heaping on 
he helpless population.

like to speak to the Prime Minister in his presence. So we went in. 
After seeing the papers the Prime Minister turned to me and asked if 
I had anything to say. I said “I totally disagree with the recommen- 
dation. The code offered might well be a discarded one. What facili- 
ties has the ambassador sitting in Paris got to ascertain genuineness? 
The payment involved is a secret one and no formal receipt will be 
obtained. Moreover I will not entrust so much unaccountable money 
to a man who changed “suzrainty” to “soverignty” while in Peking 
and subsequently told fibs about it.” The Prime Minister said “regard- 
less of what you have said, if you had put up the telegram to me strai- 
ght away, I would have unhesitatingly said that Panikkar should be 
informed that we are not interested.” 

For some mysterious reason Lord Mountbatten was keen that India 
should institute the system of honours and awards. He recognised that 
the Constitution was to prohibit titles. He quoted the example of the 
Soviet Union but did not quote the examples of France and the United 
States. After much hesitation and procrastination, honours and awards 
for civilians were instituted subsequent to Mountbatten’s departure. 
At first the awards were Padma Bhushan Tisra Varg, Padma Bhushan 
Dusra Varg, Padma Bhushan Pahle Varg, and Bharat Ratna. Many 
recepientstook exception to the classifications as in a railway train and 
returned their awards to the President. Subsequently the nomenclature 
was changed to Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, and 
Bharat Ratna. Curiously, Nehru spent much time in pondering over to 
which British honours our honours should be equated. At last he spelt 
it out in one of his fortnightly letters to the Chief Ministers which 
were also circulated to Governors, Chief Commissioners, Central 
Ministers and Heads of missions abroad. According to this, Padma Shri 
was equivalent to CSI, Padma Bhushan to KCSI, Padma Vibhushan 
to GCSI, and Bharat Ratna to KG &amp; OM. It was pitiful to watch a 
man like Nehru wasting his time on this futility. 

In the first list of honours the name of President Rajendra Prasad 
was not included. This “lapse” met with considerable critiscism. The 
first act of Radhakrishnan, after assuming the oflSce of President, was 
to confer Bharat Ratna on ex-president Rajendra Prasad. The Home 
Ministry w'as then directed to enter Rajendra Prasad’s name as the first 
on the list of Bharat Ratnas. Rajendra Prasad was thus presumed to 
have been the first recepient of Bharat Ratna. This reminded me of 
the catholic church bestowing on St Peter posthumously the office of 
“Bishop of Rome” and “Pope” long after the term “Pope” was inven- 
ted. Even today historians of the catholic church are not certain that 



154 


My Days with Nehru 

St Peter ever visited Rome. They are certain of only St Paul visiting 
the “Eternal City.” 

I felt glad when the Janata government abolished these superflous, 
dubious and anomalous honours and awards. 

Nehru took considerable time to differentiate between Nehru the 
freedom fighter and crusader and Nehru the Prime Minister and states- 
man. This caused repeated embarrassments especially when he spoke 
off the cuff. Once there was a meeting in Bombay to celebrate Paul 
Robeson’s birthday. M.C. Chagla was the moving spirit behind it, 
Nehru complied with a request to send a message for the occasion. 
For some reason I did not see the message before it was despatched to 
Chagla by post. The Secretary-General of External Affairs Ministry, 
who received a copy of the message, showed it to me and said that 
the wording of the message would annoy the United States government. 
On enquiry I found the message had already been posted. I saw the 
Prime Ministerand told him that while the treatment of Paul Robeson 
in the United States had been shocking in the extreme, it was part of 
the popular hysteria whipped by that evil man Senator McCarthy. I 
said it would be advisable to delete the sentences condemning the 
United States government. I asked him how the Government of India 
would feel if some prominent Americans held a function in New York 
to celebrate Sheikh Abdullah’s birthday and the American President 
sent a message condemning the Government of India’s action in keep- 
ing Sheikh Abdullah in prison without trial? He kept quiet. He sent a 
fresh message deleting the offending lines but retaining the personal 
warmth of feeling towards Paul Robeson, to replace the original one. 
Chagla, who is fond of seeing his name in print, committed the indes- 
cretion of making public that the first message was amended. 

Election time is one during which most people are expansive, some 
are irresponsible, some have fevered brains, some have loosened ton- 
gues and some have sharpened wits. I shall give two examples. In the 
backward area of the not very advanced state of Orissa the Ganatantra 
party dominated by feudal ex-maharajas who conducted its campaign 
against the Congress by bringing in the Mahanadi Dam for attack. 
Many speakers told the gullible people, with telling effect, that the 
water then available from the river was worthless for cultivation as the 
Congress had taken away all the electricity from it. 

In Delhi a communal party spread the slogan “Break open Rama's 
heart, you will find Sita written on it; break open Nehru’s heart, you 
will find Lady Mounibatten written on it.” 

I came across M.A. Jinnah in 1946 in Simla during the conference 
convened by the British Cabinet Mission. Nehru and party, including 



Some Disjointed Facts 


155 


Maulana Azad, stayed at the “Retreat” close to the Viceroy’s Lodge, 
and Jinnah and party stayed at the “Yarrows” nearby. 1 1 fell to my lot 
to deliver communications personally to Jinnah. It was Nehru who 
corresponded with Jinnah on behalf of the Congress even though 
Maulana Azad was the Congress President. Whenever I went to 
“Yarrows” I found Jinnah sitting out in the sun. It was summer. Jinnah 
invariably stood up to receive letters from me. He showed no hurry 
in opening the letters and always found a few minutes to exchange 
pleasantries. 

While Lord Wavell, Nehru, Jinnah and Baldev Singh were travelling 
in the Viceroy’s aircraft to London in December 1946 at the invita- 
tion of Prime Minister Attlee, I happened to be seated in front of 
Jinnah. At 11 O’ clock sharp Jinnah ordered beer. When the beverage 
arrived, Jinnah tapped me on the shoulder. When I turned round, he 
smlied and offered me a mug of beer. I thanked him and said that I 
was not used to the fluid. He understood. Readers need not think that 
I am investing myself with the virtue of a teetotaller. What I said to 
Jinnah was true of the period. I never considered abstaining from alco- 
holic drinks a virtue. 

Michael Breacher, the Canadian Jew, came to see me with a letter 
of introduction from Lord Mountbatten in connection with the writ- 
ing of a book on Nehru. For this Breacher was given a lavish grant by 
the Ford Foundation to cover the travelling and prolonged stay in 
India for himself, his wife and children. He managed to write a political 
biography of Nehru noted for its journalese. During his stay in India 
he was provided with an opportunity to accompany Nehru on one 
of his tours in India to enable him to observe Nehru at close quarters 
in all his moods. He was also given access to a copy of the typed 
manuscript containing old letters which were then under print as a 
book under the title “A Bunch of Old Letters.” Then he asked for a 
tape-recorded interview. I agreed on the understanding that he would 
have the exclusive right over the record for purposes of his book but 
that the copy-right would vest in the National Herald. He agreed to 
it. Later he said he would bring the tape-recorder and undertake to 
have the typescript prepared for the National Herald. I said he need 
not take the trouble and that All India Radio would tape-record the 
interview and the Prime minister’s PAs would make copies of the 
type-script. 

As soon as the typescript was ready, I sent a copy to M. Chalapathi 
Rao and asLed him to publish it as a copyright series straight away. 
After ascertaining that Chalapathi Rao had received the stuff, 1 gave 
a copy to Breacher. The next day we went off to Belgrade in Yugosla- 



156 


, My Days with Nehru 


via. In Belgrade Prem Bhatia of the Statesman, now Editor-in-Chief, 
The Tribune, who was in the press party covering Nehru’s visit, com- 
plained that National Herald was publishing the Breacher interview 
which was sold in advance to the Statesman by Breacher. He asked 
me if I had given permission to the National Herald. I e.xplained the 
position to him and said “true to his name, Breacher has committed 
breach of agreement.” Prem Bhatia’s comment was crisp: “a Jew is a 
Jew.” 

A little before the Planning Commission was constituted, A.V. Pai, 
Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, conveyed a request 
of a group of senior officers of the government for a meeting with the 
Prime Minister to discuss the question of planning. The group was led 
by F.C. Badhwar, Chairman of the Railway Board, and included H.M. 
Patel, ICS, Secretary in the Defence Ministry. Badhwar is an engineer 
by training and took bis engineering degree from Cambridge. Badhwar, 
who retired over 20 years ago, was one of the finest officers in the 
Government of India. He was the file-pushing type. A rare man of 
varied interests from wildlife to gardening, Badhwar was a lover of 
horses and polo and generally a keen sportsman. He knew the art of 
living well and graciously and where and how to find a good wife. H.M. 
Patel had established a reputation as a competent civil servant, but he 
was over-engined and overwhelming insofar as his collegues and 
juniors were concerned. Like an elephant, he needed only three hours 
of sleep at night. He used his ample spare time in reading. 

Nehru was glad to meet the group of senior officials and asked them 
to express their views on planning. Patel held forth and attacked the 
very concept of planning. In this respect Sardar Patel could hardly 
have done better. On the whole the group of officials was not enthusia- 
stic about planning. Their views on planning were similar to those 
of M.R. Masani. They saw' “red” in planning which, as a concept, 
was not familiar to them. 

The Swatantra party, which he joined when it was formed, provided 
the ideal habitat for H.M. Patel. Ironically, he is now one of the archi- 
tects of planning in the Janata government. Patel should remind him- 
self daily of the saying of Thomas A. Kempist: 

“Verily, w'hen the Day of judgment comes, 

I shall not be asked what I read. 

But What I did w'hen opportunity came my way.” 

At the time of partition, government servants were given the oppor- 
tunity to opt for service in either dominion. A Syrian Christian from 
Kerala, who was a permanent servant of the Madras government, was

157 


thea working as a Superintendent in the Constituent Assembly 
Secretariat in New Delhi on deputation. Thinking that he would 
have better prospects in Pakistan, he opted for service in Pakistan. 
He thought that it was like working in Singapore or Malaya. It 
did not occur to him that Pax Britannica was finished in the Sub- 
continent and that in Karachi he had to take an oath of allegiance to 
Pakistan. In ignorance he went and was soon disillusioned about pros- 
pects of rapid advancement in Pakistan. Soon the long arm of the law 
reached Madras and Kerala. His house in Madras and the land he pos- 
sessed in Kerala were declared evacuee property and taken over by 
the Government of India. The man sitting in Karachi was stunned and 
felt foolish like the squirrel which lost its nut. His numerous appeals 
fell on deaf ears. At last he wrote to me in desperation. The Prime 
Minister mentioned the matter in the Rehabilitation Committee of the 
cabinet which directed that the house and land should be restored to 
the man. Eventually he gave up his job and came away from Pakistan. 
Declaring the house and land of the man as evacuee property was 
perhaps legal in the narrow sense, but it was lacking in commonsense 
— something similar to the arrest of Frederic March in the “dry” area 
of the Madras state for possessing a bottle of scotch whisky. What 
the police did was not illegal but woefully lacking in commonsense. 
What is legal is not always right. 

Another Syrian Christian from Kerala happened to be in Karachi 
working for Caltex Oil Company at the time of partition. When the 
time came for his annual leave, he discovered that he was stranded. He 
applied to the Indian High Commission in Karachi and drew blank. 
All his efforts failed. Then he telegraphed to me. The Prime Minister 
intervened, and the Indian High Commission was instructed to issue 
travel documents to him. 

While Rajaji was, for a brief period. Chief Minister of Madras after 
being Governor-General and Home Minister in Delhi, Nehru visited 
the state. On the recommendation of the Union Health Ministry, the 
Prime minister agreed to visit the Christian Medical College and.Hospi- 
talat Vellore during the tour. For some inexplicable reason the Madras 
government had never been friendly towards this institution which 
never took any grant from the Madras government and did not permit 
it to interfere in its internal affairs. Rajaji did not like the inclusion 
of a visit to the institution in the Prime Minister’s tour programme 
without clearance from the Madras government. A mild protest was 
registered with the Prime Minister’s Secretariat by the Chief Secretary 
to the Madras government. The Chief Secretary was told in no uncer- 
tain terms that in cases such as the Vellore College and Hospital and

T.B. Sanotorium at Madanapalle (the first of its kind in India), which 
were well-known all over India and enjoyed considerable international 
reputation, the Prime Minister was in no need of advice from the 
local government. The great dedicated old woman. Dr Ida Scudder, 
the founder of the Vellore institution, was greatly touched by the Prime 
Minister's visit. 

During Chou En lai’s first visit to India, Nehru was in a buoyant 
mood. Chou En lai said that he was lacking in experience in interna- 
tional affajrs. He also told Nehru that China was way behind India in 
communications, science and technology. These pleasantries added to 
Nehru’s buoyancy. 

Nehru had noticed more than once the sloppy way K.M. Panikkar 
dressed. His collar and sleeves were often soiled. In Cairo Nehru 
noticed at the embassy the sofas were discoloured by oil from Panikkar’s 
head. We were on our way to London and were staying in the High 
Commissioner’s residence at 9, Kensington Palace Gardens, (Millio- 
naire’s Lane), London. The High Commissioner was Vijaya Lakshmi 
Pandit. One morning we were having breakfast. Vijaya Lakshmi and 
Indira left the table early to attend to something. Nehru suddenly 
remembered Panikkar. He told me that Panikkar reminded him of the 
Chief of an&gt; African tribe of very tall people who went about nude. 
The chief happened to see an English top-hat and fell in love with it. 
He ordered half a dozen and carefully stored them. On an important 
tribal occasion the Chief arrived ceremoniously with the top-hat on 
but with nothing else! Nehru could hardly contain his laughter, but he 
suppressed it. Nehru never laughed aloud. 

Panikkar was an interesting character. In an expansive mood he once 
told me two things which were personal. One was that he did not know 
who his father was. There was a practice among certain Nair families 
of Kerala to arrange for Namboodiri Brahmins to be informal mates 
for their young women. After these women gave birth to two or three 
children, the Namboodiri Brahmins were discarded. The origin of this 
practice was perhaps a certain inferiority complex among Nairs and 
also perhaps designed to improve the breed from the point of view of 
grey matter. Panikkar said that as a young boy he was told that his 
father was a Namboodiri Brahmin. The Namboodiri Brahmins used 
to indulge in consummate hypocrisy and self-deception in this matter. 
Namboodiri Brahmins were not supposed to mingle with Nairs who 
are Shudras. In order not to be seen, they visited the residences of 
the Nair women only after night-fall; they left much before sunrise. 
There was no marriage. There was no responsibility about the children. 
It cost the Namboodiri Brahmins nothing. Physical contact with Nairs 



Some Disjointed Facts 


159 


meant pollution for the Namboodiri Brahmins. To avoid “physical 
contact,” the Namboodiri Brahmin would place a betel-leaf over the 
navel of the Nair woman just before the sex act. The self-deception 
arising out of double-think is a part of our “ancient culture” and 
tradition about which we hear so much from some of our ministers 
with barren minds. Thispractice of giving Nair women toNamboodiris 
became widespread at one time, especially in northern Kerala. Chandu 
Menon wrote two powerfully satirical and widely-read novels — ‘■‘Indti- 
lekha'’ and ‘'Slwrada " — attacking the practice which is now on its way 
out. 

The second thing Panikar told me was about his marriage. On 
Panikkar’s return from England, where he had gone for higher educa- 
tion, Panikkar’s imperious uncle sent for him and asked him to get 
ready to go with him in a small boat to watch the turbulent floods. 
Panikkar gat a fright because he did not know how to swim, but he 
could not say “no” to the uncle who was very much aware of Panikkar’s 
predicament. In the beat Panikkar witnessed the fury of the floods. 
Suddenly the uncle said “Madhavan, I have arranged your marriage. 
It will take place next Monday.” Panikkar had never seen the girl. He 
was in a jam. In a small boat on the flood waters with no knowledge 
of swimming his position was so hopeless that he could not even plead 
for time. So Panikkar bowed to the inevitable and nodded his respect- 
ful agreement. That is how Kavalam Madhava Panikkar got married. 
He has not been. on record as having said “and lived happily ever 
afterward.” 

I have heard many people say that Nehru was a poor judge of people. 
I never shared this view. The faetthatNehru was circumspect in airing 
his personal views about individuals did not mean that he did not know 
them or that he was taken in by them. He was capable of acting extre- 
mely cleverly when he chose. 

One day Nehru related to me, with great relish, a confrontation 
he had with a former maharaja of Patiala who was a legendary figure 
(he was the father of Maharaja Yadavendra Singh). On a summer day 
in Simla, long before independence, Nehru was looking at some books 
in a book-shop. The Maharaja walked in and took Nehru to a quiet 
corner. The maharaja said that he and his brotherprinces were at heart 
for the elimination of the British and the independence of the country 
and would not hestitate to join hands with the Congress. But he wanted 
to know what the position of the princes would be in the Congress 
scheme of things after gaining independence. Nehru told him that it 
was a matter which could be adjusted by discussions. Before leaving, 
the maharaja said “think over it.” 



160 


My Days with Nehru 

Nehru knew that maharaja would atonce be reporting to the Poli- 
tical Department of the Government of India suppressing what he 
himself said and cooking up things which Nehru did not say. So Nehru 
wrote a longish letter to the maharaja recalling in detail what the 
maharaja said and not concealing what Nehru himself said. Nehru also 
asked for specific suggestions from the maharaja to enable him to 
discuss the matter with Gandhi and his principal colleagues. The letter 
was purposely sent by post so that the CID could intercept it and pass 
on a copy to the political Dapartment. The maharaja never replied. 
Nehru chuckled and added “The maharaja must have got a fright when 
he learn’t that the Political Department received a copy from the 
GID.” ' 

During the grace period of six months after the death of Rajkumari 
Amrit Kaur’s elder brother, Lt Col Kanwar Shumshere Singh in May 
1975, 1 was worried about the fate of my personal Library as I could 
not house it in any modest place I might rent in New Delhi. The library 
contained, apart from a good collection, some rare books over hundred 
years old, innumerable books which were out of print, very many 
expensive illustrated art books, a large number of books on natural 
history, and many reference books. Barring scientific and technical 
books, the library contained books on every conceivable subject. It 
was perhaps the largest personal library in New Delhi. It represented 
a collection spread over a period of about fifty years. A wealthy 
University was prepared to buy the library at a considerable price; but 
I was repelled by the thought of selling my books as normal parents 
would be at the idea of selling their children. Finally 1 donated my lib- 
rary to the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi and felt light 
of mind. 

It had been my practice to be the first to say “Happy New Year” 
and “Happy Birthday” to Nehru as long as I was with him. Indira was 
invariably annoyed and once she complained to me that I didn’t let her 
be the first. I said I could not help it as I happened to be working at 
midnight. I recommended to her to keep awake and I would be content 
to be second. This she could not do. 

Before leaving Delhi for good at the end of October 1977, 1 called 
on an old friend who was in indifferent health. He used to be Vijaya 
Lakshmi Pandit’s speech-writer in Washington and New York. Like 
her niece Indira, Vijaya Lakshmi could not do without a ghost writer. 
He told me that the day before, Vijaya Lakshmi had asked him to write 
for her, her autobiography. He was taken aback because he had never 
heard of a person writing the autobiography of another. He excused 
himself by pleading ill-health. I told my friend that there was a similar 
case in the past. Vincent Sheean received in New York an urgent 



Some Disjointed Facts 


161 


telegram from the Aga Khan (1875-1957) requesting him to go over to 
Paris for a meeting. The Aga Khan had made advance arrangements 
for Vincent Sheean’s travel. The latter arrived in Paris where the Aga 
Khan warmly received him. After exchange of pleasantries, the Aga 
Khan said that he would very much like Vincent Sheean to write his 
(Aga Khan's) autobiography. The fee and perquisits offered were 
princely. Since Vincent Sheean had no intention of becoming a hack- 
writer, he excused himself and took the first available plane to New 
York. 

In the early sixties Vijaya Lakshmi had told me that the manuscript 
of her book was already with her publisher and that the fee she would 
receive for the serialization of the book would be as high as that paid 
to Winston Churchill. I felt sorry for her, because I did not believe a 
word of what she said. 

Feroze Gandhi was privately helped by Finance Minister C.D. 
Deshraukhwith confidential information about the affairs of some Life 
Insurance companies. During the discussion in the Lok Sabha on the 
subject Feroze Gandhi made a speech. Certain portions of Feroze 
Gandhi’s tutored speech were deleted by several responsible newspa- 
pers for fear of being haulded up for defamation. The law in India at 
that time was, as in the Mother of Parliaments. MPs could say any- 
thing in the Indian Parliament without attracting prosecution for libel. 
But, as in England, newspapers did not enjoy any immunity from 
prosecution for publishing libellous portions of Parliamentary proceed- 
ings. In Hyde Park and in Parliament the British have provided free 
scope for cranks and politicians to blow their tops and make themsel- 
ves ridiculous, but they have wisely limited their audience. 

Feroze Gandhi sponsored a private Member’s Bill to extend immu- 
nity to newspapers. When the draft Bill came to the Prime Minister 
for a decision on the government’s attitude, I told Nehru that it would 
be a serious mistake to support the Bill. I mentioned that legislators 
liked to see their names in the newspapers and for this purpose they 
would throw restraint to the winds, and it could only amount to put- 
ting a premium on irresponsibility, cowardice, and licence in the legis- 
latures and indirectly in the press and the public. I added that such 
unbridled and uninhibited behaviour on the part of legislators could 
only bring legislatures into disrepute. Nehru agreed with me, but he 
said that the temper of the House was very much in favour of such a 
Bill. So he allowed himself to be led — with disastrous consequences 
for the future. One of the few good things Indira did during the 
emergency was to repeal the Feroze Gandhi Act. In its eagerness to 
appear as champions of press freedom, the Janata party hastily repe- 



J62 


My Days with Nehru 


aled the repeal, putting the Feroze Gandhi Act back on the Statute 
Book, without assessing the full implications of the measure. 

I believe it was in 1962 that the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Com- 
mittee passed a resolution stipulating that Congressmen, who had 
served as ministers for ten years or more, should cease to hold govern- 
ment olBce. Most people believed that it was designed to deny another 
term to Dr Jivaraj Mehta as Chief Minister and that the move was 
inspired by Morarji Desai who was then out of government under the 
Kamaraj Plan. At the meeting of the Congress Working Committee 
Nehru denounced the GPCC resolution. 1 here was a clash between 
iiim and Morarji. Eventually the GPCC resolution was implemented 
and Dr Jivaraj Mehta was out. More to show' his annoyance than any- 
thing else, Nehru announced the appointment of Jivaraj Mehta as 
India’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and concurrently 
Ambassador to Ireland. Jivaraj Mehta was a distinguished doctor, an 
able medical administrator, and a freedom-fighter, but he was never 
interested in foreign affairs. Moreover he was too old and had two 
embarrassing handicaps. He belched frequently and secondly he 
could not contain himself. Nehru’s appointment of Jivaraj Mehta as 
High Commissioner has only been surpassed in inappropriateness by 
Morarji’s appointment of two non-official male Governors in the 
south after the Janata party came to power in 1977. 

After Jivaraj Mehta presented his credentials to the Queen in 
Buckingham Palace, a well-known Indian doctor in England asked his 
friend the Queen’s Lord Chamberlain “did the Indian High Commis- 
sioner belch in her Majesty’s presence?.” The prompt reply was “yes 
indeed, both ways!” Jivaraj Mehta did not fail to repeat his perfor- 
mance in the presence of President De Valera in Dublin. 

The appointment of Jivaraj Mehta proved to be a case of Nehru 
cutting his own nose to spite his face. 

I asked the two best Cabinet Secretaries Nehru had — N.R. Pillai 
and M.K. Vellodi — about their dealings with Nehru in matters of 
administration. Both said that Nehru’s handling of administrative 
matters which passed through their hands was marked by a sense of 
fairness. He always had an open mind and invariably gave them a 
patient hearing. He never had favourites. In regard to promotions of 
officials whom he did not know personally, the standing instruction 
was that the proposals submitted by the Cabinet Secretary and Esta- 
blishment Board to the Appointments Committee of the cabinet, of 
which the Prime Minister was the chairman, should ensure that no 
injustice was done to any individual.

Bank of India, once complained privately that officials were no more 
than numbers for Nehru. The same complaint was voiced by Lord 
Norman Brook, the British Cabinet Secretary, about Winston Chur- 
chill. 



20 An Undiplomatic Letter to a Diplomat 

Walter R. Crocker, former Australian High Commissioner in India 
and later in Kenya, published the book “NEHRU— A Contemporary’s 
Estimate” in 1966. Earlier, during a trip to India from Kenya, he had 
had some talks with me in connection with the book on which he was 
then working. 

When the book was published, he had asked his publishers in 
Londomto send me a complimentary copy which took a mighty long 
time to reach me. In the meantime he wrote and asked for my 
comments on his book. I wrote to him a long letter which I reproduce 
below; 


2, Willingdon Crescent, 

‘ New Delhi-4, India 

Personal &amp; Confiucnnat 13th June 1966 

My dear Mr. Crocker, 

In one of your letters you had expressed a wish to have my com- 
ments on your book. Mrs Pandit, who recently secured a copy in 
Australia, lent me hfer copy; and I have just finished reading it. 

I am afraid that in order to review your book I will have to write 
a book bulkier than yours. I shall not attempt it at present. Perso- 
nally I feel, after reading your book, that you remain a discerning 
admirer of Nehru and that you retain basic goodwill towards 
India. However, I think your book will have, on the whole, hostile 
reception in India and the book might ajso do some harm to this 
country abroad. Two of your best Indian friends in Delhi told me 
a couple of days ago that they were surprised and angry at some of 
the things you have written in your book. It would be unfair on my 
part to disclose names. 

I would like to point out a few factual errors in your book. The 
Sikhs are not a race. They are a religious community. The Sikhs 
are relatively recent converts from Hinduism— the bulk of them are 
Jats, some are Harijans and the rest are Hindus. 

The Planning Commission members do not have cabinet rank. 
They rank with Ministers of State. Even Sir V.T. Krishnamachari 
had only the rank of Minister of State even though he functioned 
as the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission. 

You have referred to Nehru’s capacity to change overnight and 



An Undiplomatic Letter to a Diplomat 


165 


cited the example of the states reorganization on a linguistic basis. 
The citation is not correct. During Gandhi’s time the Congress was 
committed to the creation of linguistic states. In British India Pro- 
vincial Congresses were organized on a linguistic basis. Take the 
Madras Presidency which was one single administrative unit under 
the British. Four Independent Provincial Congress Committees 
existed there directly responsible to the All India Congress Com- 
mittee — VIZ the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, the Andhra 
Pradesh Congress Committee, the Karnataka Pradesh Congress 
Committee which also comprised the Kannada-speaking areas of 
the Bombay Presidency, and the Kerala Pradesh Congress Com- 
mittee. In fact Nehru showed consistency in the formation of 
linguistic states. Should Nehru have got up and said “consistency 
is the hob-goblin of little minds” and refused to carve out linguistic 
states is a question on which opinions can differ. 

You have referred to Indian villagers bewailing the exit of the 
British and asking the question “when are the British coming back?.” 
I have never heard this except from Rajkumari Amrit Kaur who had 
no contact with villagers and whose political understanding was 
woefully deficient. She also used to hold forth about the “blunder” 
of eliminating the Indian princes and the big landlords. Indeed she 
w'as a victim of her own background. In many ways she belonged to 
a dead past which neither she nor anyone else could resurrect. 

Y ou talk of Indians’ weakness for the white skin. I suffer from no 
such weakness. To me some of the dark women of India are any day 
more beautiful than the bland vegetables going about as females in 
England. I am told that opposites attract each other. How about 
Europeans’ weakness for the brown skin? Four years ago, while I 
was in Badgastein (Austria), I had a great deal of trouble with white 
females who admired brown skin. 1 am a pagan, but at that time I 
was in no mood to fool around with women — white, brown, yellow 
or black. And 1 took recourse to all kinds of tactics to avoid being 
pursued by admiring females. A few years before that I was in 
Finland for a couple of days, I was struck by the beauty and 
elegance of women there. I was on an oflBcial visit and I had no time 
to spare for relaxation. During those two days 1 had amorous 
attention at social functions from at least four women — well placed 
and very beautiful. It was all due to my brown skin and net due to 
my looks which are nothing to write home about. Unfortunately (!) 
I had no time for them. Geneva is an interesting place to watch sex 
behaviour. You will see far more Swiss and other European college 
girls there pursuing Negros and Arabs than “white” men. The issue 



166 


My Days with Nehru 


involved is not money. When Nehru visited the Soviet Union as 
Prime Minister, the Indian journalist who was most popular with 
Russian girls was the PTI Correspondent Ramachandran who'is as 
black as printing ink. 

I do not deny that several benefits have accrued to us, as by- 
products, from British rule. I am convinced that the greatest harm 
done to India by Britain was the systematic arrest of natural indus- 
trial development. For selfish reasons on the part of the British, 
India was cut off from the benefits of the Industria 1 Revolution. 
Think of what Japan achieved in 75 years in the meantime. The 
British tried their best to kill the Tata Steel Plant in Jamshedpur in 
the early days. I can understand it because the British were here 
primarily for their own health and not for the Indians. Didn’t 
Britain fatten itself by ruthlessly exploiting India and other parts of 
the vast empire on which the sun never sets? And think of the 
material benefits which accrued to England from slave trade and 
piracy on the high seas! 

The first batch of 200 African slaves passing through England was 
brought by the Captain of a British ship called ‘“The Jesus.” As 
the defender of the faith Queen Victoria, in true Christain spirit, 
admonished the Captain for taking slaves, and later Knighted him. 

I presume you know something about Henry Morgan, the world’s 
greatest pirate and King of the Buccaneers — a great cheat unsur- 
passed in cruelty and perfidy. Because of the wealth he -brought to 
England, Charles II Knighted him. Not only that; after the Treaty 
of Madrid between the Spanish and English Monarchs about 
piracy. Charles II, ironically enough, sent back Sir Henry Morgan 
to Jamaica as Deputy Governor with orders to wipe out piracy 
from Caribbean waters. Sir Henry served his King, Jamaica and 
himself well and he grew constantly richer and more powerful. He 
died full of years and honours and was buried with royal pomp and 
mourning. 

It was only on the 9 June 1966 that Chester Bowles publicly 
stated that India has made more progress in the 18 years after 
Independence than in the 200 years of British rule. 

Your reference to Indian colonialism in Goa and Nagaland 
amused me. About Goa we made a mistake. We ought to have 
taken it at the time of the police .action in Hyderabad. There was 
at no time any possibility of doing business with Salazar who 
went on quoting an ancient Papal Bull for the eternal possession 
of Goa. Maccao and Hong Kong will also have to go some time. 
In another 50 years the world is likely to be quite different from 



An Undiplomatic Letter to a Diplomat 


167 


what you would like it to be. I admit that it would have been 
advisable for India to agree to President Kennedy’s advice to wait 
for six months. Salazar would not have changed, but our position 
v/ould have been strengthened. I do not ignore the duplicity of 
Krishna Menon in the Goa business for very selfish reasons. 

In dealing with the Nagas don't forget what happened to the Red 
Indians in the United States and the aboriginees in Australia over a 
long period of years. In comparison we are humane even to the 
small number of Nagas who indulge in violence, because we believe 
they are our own people. 

About Kashmir we committed some initial mistakes. India should 
not have taken the initiative to order a ceasefire until the whole of 
the state was recovered. The unilateral offer of a plebicite at the 
time of Kashmir’s accession was an error. Taking the issue to the 
United Nations was a blunder. Nehru in his early days in office was 
inexperienced in statecraft and offered plebicifies all round — in 
Kashmir, in the iFrench and Portuguese possessions in India. In 
regard to Kashmir, taking things as they are at present, I have in 
my head one or two solutions, without a plebicite, which will not 
result in much loss of face either or Pakistan or of India and which 
might work. But since I do not have the power of decision, it is 
futile to write about them. 

I find you are enamoured by some of our “old women” in public 
affairs such as Sapru, Jayakar and Shiva Rao. If Rajaji's economic 
theories are to be implemented, we will have to drastically change our 
Constitution and scrap universal adult suffrage. 1 do not think that 
Rajaji has reconciled himself to the implications of the proposition 
“One Man One Vote.” In England and other west Emopean coun- 
tries adult suffrage came after the general population had acquired 
a fairly good standard of life as a result of the Industrial Revolu- 
tion. Think of the limited suffrage in Pitt’s time. Even women did 
not ha.ve the vote. In India the reverse has been the case. We 
accepted universal adult suffrage in an economically and education- 
ally backward country. It was a great act of faith. This has pro- 
duced certain compulsions and it is in this context that the size of 
our plans should be looked at. The choice in India is between 
catching up with time, and saying good-bye to the “liberal demo- 
cratic set up” based on adult suffrage. 

Reading your book I got the impression that in many instances 
you proceeded on faulty premises. You were obviously handicapped 
by lack of inside and authentic information. I am compelled to 
observe that you have indulged in some sweeping assumptions. 1 am 



168 


My Days with Nehru 


also inclined to say that I have been somewhat mistaken about niy 
estimate of you as a person with a sense of history and of historical 
movements. In some ways you remind me of a Frenchman who Jived 
in France during the French Revolution. He dismissed the Fall of 
Bastille in the following words: 

The Kingdom was needlessly plunged into chaos and to 
massacre. Several of the invalid veterans who formed the 
garrison of the Bastille — among them its Governor, the 
Marquis de Launay, one of the gentlest souls in France, were 
massacred and the head of the latter had been paraded 
through the streets at the end of a pike. The total count of 
the inmates freed was seven— four counterfeiters, one sex 
offender, and two madmen whom the crowd had carried in 
triumph from the prison to the insane asylum. 

The figures are correct. But the verdict of history on the Fall of 
the Bastile is slightly different. It stands out as a symbol and a 
landmark in the annals of man’s quest for liberty. 

An Englishman once scornfully dismissed Gandhi’s Dandi March 
as the trudging of a half naked fakir for a handful of salt. The 
“handful of Salt’’ was the signal to an unarmed people by a frail 
and intrepid man to stand up and fight, with nothing in their hands, 
against the mightiest empire in history. The "handful of Salt” will 
live in history as a greater symbol of humanity’s march towards 
freedom than the “Fall of the Bastille.’’ 

I think one’s background as well as one’s way of looking at things 
will colour one’s judgment. For example when Gandhi stood before 
the Taj Mahal he saw only forced labour. An American million- 
airess, after a visit to India 70 years ago, told an audience in Hew 
York that the most exciting experience she had in India was the 
Aga Khan by moonlight — she actually meant the Taj Mahal. The 
Oxford historian Vincent A. Smith who was an ignorant and 
insolent ex-ICS official, wrote, that the Taj Mahal was a barbaric 
ostentation completely devoid of artistic merit. 

Haven’t you ever heard of organized and widespread corruption 
and extortion in high British ruling circles in India before Inde- 
pendence? Hardly a Viceroy and his Vicerene w'as immune from 
it. In such cases the victims were Indian princess and rich land 
lords such as taltiqdars. Shummy often refers to it as loot. Wide- 
spread official pressure used to be applied on landed gentry and 
traders for the purpose of extorting money from them for putting 
up statues of innumerable inconseouential Britishers throughout 
India. Substantial bms used to betaken as bribes at various levels

from Indian moneyed fools, outside the official world, for the grant 
of British honours. I can multiply instances. 

Thank you for your letter dated 9th June which reached me 
today. I shall convey yom message to Mr. Nambiar. Your vague 
recollection of having met him at the residence of Raghunath 
Rao in Geneva before the war may be correct. Mr. Rao and 
Mr. Nambiar are good friends. Incidentally Rao has retired as 
Assistant Director General of ILO; but he stays on in Geneva 
with his French wife. His only child, a girl, is married to a 
Rumanian emigree in Switzerland. 

I hope you will not take offence at this rather tco frank a letter.

21 Jayanti Dhanna Teja and Shipping 


Dharma Teja, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, appeared on the scene 
in Delhi after my resignation from the government in 1959. In fact 
I had heard of him and his antecedents earlier. After the death of his 
American millionairess wife, who was older than him, under myste- 
rious circumstances, Teja had acquired a young wife from the Punjab. 
He loved to parade her. 

Prime Minister Nehru was impressed by Teja as a man who could 
get things done. He was taken in by Teja’s grandoise scheme of ship- 
ping development in India. Teja was able to quote facts and figures 
about shipping and its importance to the economy which appealed to 
Nehru. Teja also enlisted the support of Mrs Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit’s 
son-in-law who is the senior executive of the multi-national pharma- 
ceutical firm in India, Ciba-Geigy of India Ltd. In fact this firm 
acquired financial interest in Jayanti Shipping Company floated in 
India by Teja under the Indian Companies Act. 

The Minister of Transport and Shipping at that time was Dr P. 
Subbaroyan, a decent man but not one of the world’s great workers. 
Nehru spoke to Dr Subbaroyan commending Dharma Teja. Dr. 
Subbaroyan passed on the matter to Dr Nagendra Singh who, 
fortunately, was the Secretary of the Ministry at that time. Dr 
Nagendra Singh hails from the Princely family of Dungarpur. He is a 
talented and scholarly man cf great personal integrity and, like his 
brother, the Maharawal of Dungarpur, the embodiment of refinement 
and culture. Dr Nagendra Singh is now a judge of the International 
Court of Justice at the Hague, and the Maharawal, I believe, the 
Speakar of the Rajasthan Assembly. 

I must digress a little here and say something about the Maharawal 
of Dungarpur. In the mid-fifties, in the wake of a bout of public 
criticism of the unusually large privy purses and privileges of the 
Indian princes, President Rajendra Prasad and the Home Minister ' 
persuaded Prime Minister Nehru to write individual personal letters to 
all the Indian princes suggesting the desirability of voluntary action on 
their part to effect cuts in their privy purses or to share some of it with 
the people of their former states. The- response to the appeal did not 
amount to much. Some did create Trusts or otherwise made provision 


Jayanri Dhanna Teja and Shipping 


171 


to give part of their privy purses for public causes. The Nizam of 
Hyderabad, the world’s greatest miser, sent a negative brusque reply. 
The finest and ablest reply was from the Maharawal of Dungarpur. 
He said nothing about his own “poverty” and problems. He pleaded 
the cause of the young nmharana of Udaipur who had just ascended 
the gadi. According to the accession agreement the privy pu-'"se of 
Udaipur was drastically reduced on the death of his predecessor. 

The Maharawal of Dungarpur reminded the Prime Minister that 
the House of Udaipur was more ancient than the Japanese monarchy; 
the maharana had descended from the sun: practically all other princes 
of Rajasthan did "‘Sashtanga Namaskar'’’ (prostration) before the 
maharana of Udaipur; the great public esteem in which he was held 
was recognized by the Government of India by making him the one 
and only maharajpramtikh at the time of integration of the Indian 
states; and that even the British government recognised his unique 
position by exempting him from attendance at King George V’s durbar 
in Delhi where Indian princes had to bow low and pay homage to 
the King Emperor. The Maharawal appealed to the. Prime Minister 
not only not to put pressure on the young maharana, but to restore the 
cut to a substantial extent. The Prime Minister was much impressed 
by the letter and promptly invited the young maharani to come to 
Delhi and stay in the P.M’s House for leisurely talks with him, the 
President and the Home Minister. 

The young maharana came and stayed in the P.M’s House for 
several days, and met President Rajendra Prasad and the Home 
Minister. As a result the Home Ministry made substantial adjustments 
in his privy purse to ease the sudden drop effected after the death of 
his predecessor. 

Dr Nagendra Singh came to see me for a private talk although I 
was not then officially connected with the PM. He said he was some- 
what disturbed at the manner in which Dharma Teja was sponsored 
by the PM. Because of this, he feared, healthy resistance to unorthodox 
procedures might break down at all levels and ultimately the whole 
thing might end in a scandal. He said that in the Indian context 
“Private Sector” in shipping had become a misnomer in as much as 
90 per cent of the price of every ship was given as a loan to private 
companies from the Shipping Development Fund. 

I told Nagendra Singh “the PM is obviously impressed by the 
enterprise and adventurousness of Teja. Nehru is not the man to have 
any ulterior motives in sponsoring any individual. If you are convinced 
that Teja is not to be encouraged, then you should fearlessly place 
the facts before the PM at an interview. If there is no basis for that, 
you should assist Teja’s company like any other Shipping firm, safe- 



172 


My Days with Nehru 


guarding government’s interests completely in the process. In view of 
your apprehensions, you should be doubly careful in government’s 
dealings with Teja.” I asked him how government safeguarded the 90 
per cent advance to a shipping firm. He replied “the vessel cannot be 
sold or otherwise alienated by the firm until the entire loan is repaid 
to the government.” 

Nagendra Singh told me “there is a big racket going on in ship- 
ping business. For every ship ordered by a shipping firm, the foreign 
supplier allows a minimum of two per cent commission on new ships 
and anything upto seven per cent or more on second-hand ships. Such 
commissions are not taken cogniganceof officially by the government. 
In the Shipping Corporation of India I introduced the practice of 
receiving the commission in India and crediting the amount in the 
account books of the corporation; but in the shipping companies in 
the private sector the commission is shared by the Directors, never 
repatriated to India, no income tax is paid on it in India, and is tucked 
away in foreign banks — in short government is abetting income tax 
evasion and foreign exchange swindle on a substantial scale by a few. 
I am determined to bust this racket and ensure that the customary 
commission is entered in the accounts of the firms and not parcelled 
out to the directors.” 

I asked Nagendra Singh what he could do if second-hand ships 
were over-invoiced by the suppliers and, through some private arrange- 
ment with the Indian shipping firms, the money is given to the 
Directors in foreign exchange abroad. I pointed out to him-the general 
practice of under-invoicing exports and over-invoicing imports in 
other commodities resulting in large-sca’e leakage of foreign exchange 
and income tax evasion which the Ministry of Commerce and Industry 
was unable to stamp out. Nagendra Singh did not have a satisfactory 
answer. He, however, said that shipping was the easiest industry to be 
nationalized as the quantum of payment of compensation was very 
limited, and that nationalization was the onlv ultimate solution. 

I pointed out the Nagendra Singh “government at various levels is 
run by people with accountants’ minds. The worst is the Accouatant- 
General, Central Revenues (AGCR) Office. I know a case of a man 
whose pension for July-September 1959 was sanctioned by the AGCR 
on production of the necessary forms “duty filled in” with a “life 
certificate” to indicate that he has alive as of 30 September 1959. But 
the AGCR refused to pass the pension bill for April-June 1959, 
because no “life certificate” to the effect that he was alive as on 30 June 
1959, was attached to the pension bill. Now, tell me, isn’t a man who 
is alive on 30 September 1959 also alive on 30th June 1959? Can’t the 



Jayanti Dharma Teja and Shipping 


173 


AGCR understand this elementary fact of life? Does the AGCR live 
in the age of miracles? Does it believe in death and resurrection? The 
plain fact is that these are mentally dead men who are interested only 
in keeping papers complete even with needless ones. These men in 
government revel in the futile exercise of swallowing a camel and 
straining at a gnat.” 

It cannot be denied that Dharma Teja did, within a few years, add 
considerably to India’s maritime fleet. He appointed Lt. General 
B.M. Kaul (retd.) as his “ambassador” in Japan during Nehru’s life- 
time. He ofFered an attractive position later to R.K. Nehru who, as a 
retired civil servant, had to take government’s permission to accept 
the post. But the new Prime Minister Lai Bahadur, refused to accord 
permission. One of Nehru's PA’s resigned without earning a pension 
and joined Teja’s Jayanti Shipping Company on a salary and per- 
quisites he could never dream of getting at any time in government or 
elsewhere. Ultimately, of course, the poor PA lost everything. 

As Prime Minister Nehru’s hostess, Indira was over-indulgent to 
Teja and his wife. At social functions in the PM’s House the Tejas 
were conspicuous guests. During one such function in the PM’s House, 
where important ministers and some senior officials were present, 
Teja’s wife had the temerity to kiss Nehru. This was deliberately done 
to create impressions. What can even a Prime Minister do if a calcula- 
ting woman grabs him and kisses him except to look embarrassed? 

For a considerable time this was the talk of the town. And Teja and 
his wife strutted about triumphantly in Delhi and elsewhere. Later, 
after the death of Nehru, Indira paid the price for it in the form of 
several embarassing questions in Parliament about Teja looking after 
her two sons in England and France. Neither was Mrs Vijaya 
Lakshmi Pandit spared, as it subsequently came out in the court from 
a statement by Teja himself that he had given money to Mrs Pandit 
to buy a jeep for her election. Mrs Pandit has not contradicted it so 
far. 

Teja over-reached himself and came to grief. Because of the pre- 
cautions taken by Nagendra Singh, government lost nothing. Recent 
press reports about Teja’s final exit from India and the “losses” 
government is going to suffer as a result are highly uninformed. Teja’s 
income-tax arrears are a different matter. In any event they are inflated 
and include fantastic expropriatory fines. Teja’s foray into India only 
resulted in his ruin. All his shares in the Jayanti Shipping Company 
stand forfeited to the government. Then there is the value of ships 
taken over by the government from Teja’s company. All these add up 
to much more than anything Teja owes to the government by way of 



174 


My Days with Nehru 


income-tax or any other dues. Teja’s mistake was that he did not 
.realise that it is impossible to become an Aristotle Socrates Onasis by 
gambling with government money. Teja should have stayed on abroad 
either in Panama or in Monte Carlo. He could have remained there 
as a millionaire but for his insane desire to be a multi-millionaire. 

In November 1970 Dharma Teja said in a London Court that in 
1966, while Indira was the Prime Minister, Uma Shankar Dikshit, 
Indira’s factotum, asked him for Rs 10 lakhs for the National Herald, 
and that subsequently there was a meeting of Teja with Commerce 
Minister Manubhai Shah in the presence of Dikshit, At the meeting 
Manubhai Shah told Teja that if he did not give Rs 10 lakhs for the 
National Herald, that would be the end of him. That was a time when 
Teja was having trouble with the government of India. Teja’s evidence 
before the London Court was reported in detail in the Indian Press, 
and remains uncontradicted. 

It is well known that many of the shipping firms declare dividends 
even when there is no profit. A shipping firm in the south indulges in 
lavish self-entertainment at an expensive hide-out and enters the 
expense under the head “amenities.” Amenities for whom? Workers 
and lowpaid staff? No, but well-paid senior executives and their wives. 
This firm paid Rs five lakhs for advertisements in the souvenir of the 
Indira Congress for the illfated 1977 general elections. The company 
has a vested interest in political parties. 

Probably because of his early exit from the Ministry of Transport 
and Shipping, Nagendra Singh was unable to stop payment of com- 
missions to directors of shipping firms in the private sector and to 
ensure their entry in the accounts of the firms. Recently a south 
Indian shipping firm bought a large second-hand ship for Rs. 14 
crores. Was any commission on it received and, if so, has the amount 
been distributed among the directors in foreign exchange abroad, or 
has it been credited to the accounts of the shipping firm? Five per 
cent of Rs 14 crores amounts to Rs 70 lakhs. This shipping firm has 
the distinction of the former Chairman of its Board of Directors 
having been hauled up by the Reserve Bank of India for giving a lavish 
party in New York for which there was no foreign exchange sanction, 
and the frequent travels of himself and his entire family to western 
countries without foreign exchange sanction. On suspicion that be 
was doing all these on dollars which came out of the commissions on 
ships tucked away in foreign exchange abroad, the Reserve Bank of 
India started its proceedings. I do not know if the proceedings ended 
first or that death, timely and kind, saved him from possible ignominy 
and vvorse. 



Jayanti Dbanna Teja and Shipping

Why should the south Indian shipping firm put up the wife a senior 
-official of the Government of India for an extensive period in its guejt 
"house? Why should the Lieutenant Governor of a union Territory 
■stay in the guest house of this shipping firm and be lavishly enter- 
tained with everything thrown in? Why can't he stay in the Raj 
Bhawan? 

The Chief Executive of the Hindustan Shipyard at Vishakha- 
patanam, a Government of India undertaking, called on the Managing 
Director of the south Indian shipping firm in the early seventies in an 
efifort to induce him to keep the shipyard in view when planning for 
long-range requirements of new ships. He had the audacity to say that 
he was neither interested in the shipyard nor in the Indian ship- 
building industry. This south Indian shipping firm has so far success- 
fully' avoided placing a single order with the Hindustan Shipyard or 
any other Indian shipyard. 

Prime Minister Morarji Desai recently cautioned the shipping firms 
against unhealthy practices and hinted at government takeover in this 
connection. He seems to have gradually come to the same conclusion 
as Nagendra Singh did 18 years ago that nationalization of shipping 
was desirable, easy, and the only solution. 



22 Meaning of Humiliation and Insult 


Soon after Morarji Desai formed the government at the centre early 
in 1977, Indian Express, which put on an air of being the government’s 
mouthpiece, fed by the Ministry of Works and Housing presided over 
by that intellectual and moral giant Sikhander Bhakt, published 
several reports about: 

(1) The Teen Murli would be reconverted as the official residence 
of the Prime Minister, and that the contents of the Nehru Museum 
could be taken to Anand Bhawan in Allahabad. 

(2)' The new house Indira was likely to get, the rent which would 
be charged, and that she would be required to pay six months’ 
advance rent or produce a guarantee from a gazetted officer. These 
reports remained uncontradicted by the government. 

I wrote a letter to Morarji Desai about both these matters. About 
(1) he showed commendable understanding in his prompt reply to me. 

I have referred to th's in the chapter “Prime Minister’s House” in my 
previous book. 

About (2) I had informed the Prime Minister that any action 
designed to humiliate Indira would only bring discredit to his govern- 
ment and his nascent Janata party. In his reply he quoted rules and 
added that my reference to humiliation was not understood. I did not 
wish to prolong the correspondence. 

Before I proceed further with this chapter, I would like to state 
that I firmly believe that it was a grave mistake to have made Indira 
the Prime Minister ih 1966, and it would be a great disaster and 
misfortune for India if she were to come back to power. I am con- 
vinced that only the Janata party’s follies and failures can make it 
possible for her to stage a come-back. But I would be the first to object 
to any attempt at humiliating a former Prime Minister. Punishment 
for wrong-doing, after going through the normal process of law, is a 
different matter. 

Now I would like to help Desai to understand my reference to 
humiliation and the meaning I attach to that word. A junior Section 
Officer in the Government of India is a gazetted officer. Is a former 



Meaning of Humiliation and Insult 


177 


Prime Minister to go to such an official to make a request for a 
guarantee (that she would pay rent)? If there is such a rule, I say “to 
hell with it and to hell with the people who have quoted it.” It is 
worse than humiliation to publish such nonsense and let it go 
uncontradicted. 

The number one in a country should have the audacity to break a 
rule openly when there are compelling reasons to do so and when 
commonsense dictates it. He should also have the courage to institute 
a new rule when necessary. I remember a talk B.K. Nehru had with 
me one evening while he was in an expansive mood. He held forth 
about the preciousness of red-tape and how tenderly it should be 
nurtured. My laughing at him did not deter him in the least. He 
wound up his “speech” with the remark “but it should be cut occas- 
sionally — only at the highest level and after mature consideration.” 
There is truth in what Biju said. 

Morarji was able to live in a large house in New Delhi after he 
ceased to be a minister because of a new rule introduced on the 
directive of Prime Minister Nehru issued at my instance. That rule 
conferred on MPs who have been cabinet ministers, governors, and 
heads of Indian diplomatic missions abroad, as well as leaders of 
opposition groups in both Houses of Parliament entitlement to inde- 
pendent bungalows. I have referred to this in the chapter “Vijaya 
Lakshmi Pandit” in my previous book. 

It passeth my understanding why the new government did not offer 
a bouse to the former Prime Minister when she had to vacate the 
official residence. How was Abida Ahmed, wife of the former Presi- 
dent, allotted a large house when she owns one in New Delhi itself? 
How was Lalitha Shastri, wife of a former Prime Minister allotted a 
large house in New Delhi? I believe neither of them pays any rent. 
Why couldn’t Indira, who had given away her ancestral house for a 
public cause, be given a house? And what is the rent she is being 
charged for the unfurnished bungalow No. 12 Willingdon Crescent, 
her present residence? It is the murderous amount of over Rs 2,800 
per month. And what rent was Morarji paying for the large house he 
occupied as an MP? It was less than Rs 250 per month. At the present 
level of taxation, how many persons in India have an income of 
Rs 2,800 per month after taxes? How will she live? Is this socialism? 
Is this Gandhian economics? It is just highway robbery by the govern- 
ment. Is the government paying a pension to Indira who has been 
prime minister for eleven years? Most civilized governments do. 

It is known to a few that when the Janata came to power at the 
centre the two “patriarchs” from outside advised the government to 



178 


My Days with Nehru 


pick up Indira and Sanjay under MISA and send them to Tihar 
jail for 19 months so that they could taste the bitter medicine they 
administered to innumerable people during the emergency. It must 
be said to the credit of Desai that he rose above anger and revenge 
and firmly turned down the proposal. 

The arrest of Indira, taking her round in a jeep at night all over 
Delhi, with no member of her family with her was an arbitrary, crude, 
clumsy, uncivilized, vindictive and highhanded act. It proved to be a 
foolish act judged by subsequent events. It was worse than humiliation. 
The senior civil servant Vohra was also arrested, suspended, released 
and reinstated. How Gilbertian! During those days I wondered 
whether emergency had been re-established or whether Idi Amin had 
established his barbarous regime in India. What is surprising is that 
the minister concerned did not resign as a result of this imbroglio. It 
is the government and the Janata party which lost heavily in the 
process. 

Those who sit on seats of power should understand that an indi- 
vidual and a nation will forget and forgive an injury but never an 
insult. 



23 Some Foreign Dignitaries 


King Saud of Saudi Arabia 

The visit of the King of Saudi Arabia was unique in many ways. The 
guardian of the holiest of holy places for the entire Muslim world had 
an opportunity to see Islamic institutions, shrines, Mughal art and 
architecture, and to meet prominent Muslims in India. He threw 
money recklessly on tips wherever he went. On the way from Kalka to 
Simla the King’s car ran over a hen and killed it. The King at once 
stopped the car, found out the owner of the hen, and gave him a kingly 
sum as compensation which was large enough to start a mini poultry 
farm. 

The King once telephoned the Saudi Arabian Ambassador in 
New Delhi. When the ambassador learnt that the King was on the 
telephone, he sprang from his seat and just managed to say “Your 
Majesty” and then put the receiver down as a mark of respect. Later 
the ambassador told Prime Minister Nehru the story. The ambassador 
said “when I learnt it was His Majesty, I jumped up. Think of my 
speaking to His Majesty on the telephone. I was overcome by venera- 
tion for the person of my King and put the telephone down.” The 
Prime Minister said “obviously the King wanted to tell you some- 
thing.” The ambassador replied “I got out of my house at once and 
started walking to Rashtrapti Bhavan to bow to His Majesty. Then I 
was persuaded by my staff to go in the car to save time. I reluctantly 
did so. I discovered that the King fortunately thought that the tele- 
phone was out of order. Think of my speaking to His Majesty on the 
telephone.” 

At the end of Nehru’s visit to Saudi Arabia subsequently, the King 
gave me a Rolex gold watch with a gold strap. On the dial of the watch 
was engraved the image of the King’s face with his goatee. On return 
to Delhi I sent it, with a note, to the Foreign Secretary to be passed on 
to the Tosha Khana because it was an e.xpensive present. I had no in- 
tention of using that watch. The Foreign Secretary, in consultation 
with the Prime Minister, decreed that I should pay Rs 200 to the 
government and keep the watch. I was somewhat annoyed and told the 
Foreign Secretary that government had no authority to ask me to pay 


180 


My Days with Nchni 


money for something I did not want. He said that things sent to the 
Tosha Khana were sold by general auction and that the auctioning of a 
watch with the King’s image might amount to discourtesy. I was not 
satisfied, but I promised to pay. Then a member of the Prime Minis- 
ters’s Secretariat fell in love with the watch and wanted to buy it. I 
told him he could keep the watch by paying Rs 200 to the govern- 
ment on my behalf on condition that he would personally use (he 
watch and not sell it outside. He was immensely pleased because he 
knew that the watch was worth several times the money he was asked 
to pay. I derived some satisfaction that the drew pleasure out ot look- 
ing at the image of the King on the dial of the watch frequently every 
day. 

The King also presented me with a traditional Arab cloak and head- 
gear. On return to India, I lost no time in passing it on to Mohammed 
Yunus who accepted it with veneration. He prospered in life and, 
though no more than a halfwit, flashed through the “emergency” 
firmament like a comet with a bombastic designation as his tail, and is 
now heard no more. 

While in Saudi Arabia our ambassador told me that the manufac- 
ture, import and possession of soda was banned in that country. I was 
intrigued and asked him why. He said that the King believed “where 
soda is, there will whisky be.” Prohibition in Saudi Arabia is total and 
is fiercely enforced. Even foreigners from western countries are flogged 
if they commit any prohibition offence. Wealthy people from Saudi 
Arabia, including the ones in charge of enforcement of prohibition, fly 
out to Beirut in Lebanon and spend week-ends there in drinking bouts 
and in revelry of all kinds. Enforcement of “morality” by compulsion 
can never be wholly successful any where. 

The Law of Moses is 'still in force in Saudi Arabia in all its prestine 
barbarity. If a woman is caught in adultery, she is stoned to death; 
the man goes scot-free. The Arabs are the cousins of the Jews. 
In Abraham they have a common ancestor. Arabs are descended from 
Ishmail who was the eldest son of Abraham, and the Jews from Isac 
who was the younger son. Byron has something to say about the 
“offence” for which women are stoned to death. “What men call 
gallantry, and gods adultery, is much more common where the climate 
is sultry.” 

On his departure from India the King presented Nehru with a huge 
Cadillac car with provocative fins. Nehru promptly sent it to President 
Rajendra Prasad for his use. Crown Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia had, 
on an earlier occasion, also presented Nehru with a Cadillac. This was 
given away to the government hospitality organization for the use of

foreign dignitaries on their visits to Delhi. 

Aneiirin Sevan 

In my previous book as well as in the chapter “A Visit to the Soviet 
Union” in this book I have written about the colourful British Labour 
party leader Aneurin Sevan, It was Rajkumari Amrit Kaur who first 
introduced me to Nye Sevan in 1946 while he was Minister of Health 
in England. I met him and his wife Jennie Lee at their residence 
in London during Nehru’s hurried and brief visit to London with Lord 
Wavell, M.A. Jinnah and others in 1946. 

As a young boy from a very poor family in Wales Nye had to work 
in the coal mines. Working in the deep pits affected his lungs, and he 
had to live with it throughout his life, and finally die of it prematu- 
rely. Without any formal education he became one of the greatest 
orators, like his fellow Welshman David Lloyd George, Great Britain 
has produced. Winston Churchill, master of the written word, consi- 
dered Nye Sevan a natural orator. 

During my innumerable trips to England between 1946 and 1962 1 
always took Nye and Jennie to the threatre and supper. Often we went 
to Soho to eat Chinese food. I also spent some time at their farm at 
Chesham on practically every visit to England. Whether in office or out 
of it, Nye Sevan was singularly free from pomposity and behaved with 
natural dignity. 

When Attlee formed the government in 1945 Nye Sevan was 
appointed Miriister of Health. Nye was determined to launch the 
National Health Service. He discussed the matter with the Permanent 
Secretary he inherited in the ministry. He found this senior official 
singularly lukewarm about the National Health Service; but found the 
second senior-most official enthusiastic. Nye told the Permanent Secre- 
tary that he must be weary and tired after the hard work during war time 
and advised him to go on leave for a good rest. Later he was transfer- 
red from the Health Minister. In the teeth of opposition from profes- 
sional medical men and other vested interests Nye managed to push 
the National Health Service through Parliament. 

Insofar as I can remember, Nye Sevan came to India twice — once 
on the invitation of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur and later on my invitation 
while he was no longer a minister. During the first visit he stayed in 
Rajkumari Amrit Kaur’s house. On the second visit he stayed in 
the Prime Minister’s House. This time I took him to Bhakra Nangal 
and Kashmir. In between the two visits, Jennie Lee came once on my 
invitation. She visited Agra, Almora, Calcutta, Bombay, Madras 



182 


My Days with Nehru 


and several other places. It was her first visit to India. 

Once I took Nye to an after-dinner party at a friend’s house in 
Delhi. Nye was a person who could drink well and could hold it per- 
fectly. In the small party there was an Englishman who was an admirer 
of Nye. The poor fellow was somewhat tight and spoke incoherently. 
On our way back home Nye asked me what was the most disgusting 
thin g in the world and answered the question himself “the sight of an 
Englishman drunk.” 

While Nye Sevan was in India in 1957, Krishna Menon asked me 
to speak to Nye about him and to suggest to him that he might keep 
in touch with Krishna Menon as Sevan was the Foreign Secretary in 
the Labour party shadow cabinet. I told Krishna Menon “1 thought you 
had the Sritish Labour party in your pocket!” Nevertheless I spoke to 
Sevan, but his reaction was far from encouraging. 

I remember my innumerable talks with Nye both in India and in 
England. Once he told me of a plot by Stafford Cripps to oust Attlee. 
Cripps tried to enlist Nye’s support; but Nye refused. He told me that 
he disliked and distrusted men with too much religion and austerity as 
they tend to impose their fads on others. And in his Welsh accent he 
told me “Maac, Stafford is a crank.” Nye admitted that any day the 
colourless Attlee was more reliable than Cripps or any other Labour 
leader of his time. 

Nye told me of a remark by a well-known wit when Stafford 
Cripps, known for his fads, vegetarianism, Quaker meditations, Fabian 
socialism, Spartan austerity, and insufferable righteousness, was 
appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer: 

“There, but for the Grace of God, goes God.” 

I am amused to find that Hiren Mukerjee, in his book “Portrait of 
Parliament,” has used the witticism as his own about Morarji Desai. 

After the Labour government went out in 1951 I arranged for Nye 
Sevan to write a weekly column for the Indian Express. Ramnath 
Goenka was generous enough to fix a substantial fee for the weekly 
columns. In 1957 Ramnath Goenka changed the payment to a monthly 
system regardless of the number of articles Nye sent. While Nye was 
not in a position to write due to illness which proved fatal, Ramnath 
Goenka showed considerable understanding and continuedthe monthly 
payment until Nye’s untimely death. 

On 18 August 1957 Nye wrote to me a personal letter the contends of 
which are reproduced on next page. 

In the summer of 1959, while I was in London on my own, Nye and 
Jennie took me to the House of Commons for lunch. Later they got 
me a ticket for the small special enclosure which was part of the

1 have written to His Highness end also 
to Bakhshl. I am deeply indebted to you for 
the trouble that you have taken. 

The arrangement made with Hr. Remnath 
Goenka of the Escpress, I appreciate very much 
indeed. When 1 an away, for example as I shall 
be in Russia, it is a very conaiderable inconvenience 
and hardship to have to send' off an article. At 
the same tine, these visits are necessary for me, in 
order to obtain subject natter for the articles. 

On the 6th September, I am going to Poland 
and on the 11th, I shall be in Moscow. I hope not 
to be away more than about ten to twelve days in 
nll.- 


Certainly I look forwaid very much to ooeing

to visit us .at the £era. 

Again thanking you for your kindness. 

Yours affectionatoly.

House of Commons itself. On that day there was a foreign affairs 
debate. The speakers were Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and 
Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd for the government, and Hugh Gaits- 
kell and Nye Sevan for the Labour party. Nye’s speech was superb. 
The next morning I looked at all the daily newspapers. Without excep- 
tion the newspapers gave far more space to Nye’s speech than that of 
Prime Minister Macmillan. Of the total space allotted for the debate, 
the London Times gave 65 per cent to Sevan, 20 per cent to 
Macmillan, 10 per cent to Selwyn Lloyd and five per cent to Gaitskell. 
I then wondered if at any time the press in India will shed the dead 


184 


My Days with Nehru 

habit of boosting the men in government and show a healthy sense of 
proportion. 

Harold Wilson and Michael Foot were the left-wing lieutenants of 
Nye Bevan in the Labour party. Nye had mellowed with age and 
experience without losing the fire in him. Had he lived longer, he 
would have been the Prime Minister. The ways of fate and destiny are 
inscrutable. 

In I960, while I was no longer with the Prime Minister officially, 
Nehru was going to London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’ 
Conference. Nye was ill then— a mere bundle of skin and bones of 
what was once a talLand impressive-looking figure who used to create 
a flutter whenever he entered a room or an assembly of people. I 
suggested to Nehru that he might visit Nye at his farm. Nehru found 
the time to do this. He was overwhelmed by this gesture and the 
entire British press lauded Nehru for this. Nye died soon after— in 
1960 at the early age of 63. He belonged to the band of rare men of 
elemental force and grandeur who leave their footprints on the sands 
of time. 

It is a pity that Jennie Lee visited India during the emergency at the 
expense of the Government of India to tell us of the “gains of the 
emergency” and that “Indira is the best bet for India." Strangely 
enough it did not occur to her that the people of India knew more 
about the emergency and about Indira than she did. I remember Jennie 
reviling Attlee for accepting an earldom; but, when her time came, 

' she accepted the title of “Baroness” with alacrity. People do change 
sometimes. 

Marshal Josif Broz Tito 

It was Aneurin Bevan who first drew Nehru’s attention to Marshal 
Tito. After a visit to Yugoslavia, Bevan wrote to me a personal letter 
in the late forties in which he said that Tito was a considerable person 
and that he and Nehru should meet. I placed the letter before the 
Prime Minister who forwarded it to the External Affairs Ministry with 
a short note to indicate that he was in no particular hurry to meet him. 
After the arrest and imprisonment of Djilas by Tito, Sevan’s enthusiasm 
for Tito dimmed. Before his arrest, Djilas was a right hand man to 
Tito, but was later to write the book “Land Without Justice.” 

Tito the leader of a small, loosely-held and relatively under-deve- 
loped country in eastern Europe, was conscious that he and his 
country could play no meaningful role in Europe. He was anxious to 
befriend Nehru in view of the importance of India and Nehru’s pre-

eminent position among the newly emerged nations of the East and the 
magic of his name among the suppressed peoples of Africa. Tito was 
one of the earliest dignitaries to visit India. His visit was the beginning 
of “organized” receptions in Delhi and elsewhere. People of Delhi and 
the adjoining states were herded together to accord a “spontaneous” 
reception. The Delhi Administration was made responsible for the 
herding.- The Government of India had to foot the bill. The practice 
continued to be resorted to on a vast scale in the case of other visits 
such as Khrushchev and Bulganian, the British Queen, Eisenhower and 
Brezhnev. Ultimately this practice, perfected over a lengthy period, 
culminated in the vulgar and nauseating “solidarity rallies” of the 
Indira regime. “Tito” was an easy name for the villagers to remember. 
So, whenever they were herded for other dignitaries, they used to say 
“Tito again.” Perhaps it was a question of “imprint.” They have 
indeed seen many “Titos.” 

Tito has visited India more than any other foreign dignitary. 
At heart Tito is a very practical man not overburdened by pure 
idealism. He saw in Nehru his opportunity and in India and in the 
“emerging nations” scope for economic and political benefits for his 
small country. And the journalists installed him as a “founding father” 
of the non-aligned movement which is supposed to have many founding 
fathers as in the Janata party. After the exit of Nehru and Nasser, the 
journalists have installed Tito as “the Father Figure” and “the Presi- 
ding Deity” of the non-aligned movement. 

On my first visit to Yugoslavia with Nehru, we landed at a small 
airfield in Pula and motored to Brioni, the small island off the Adria- 
tic coast gifted to Tito by his countrymen. I saw ill-clad people with no 
shoes. Perhaps it is not a bad thing to go shoe-less in the climate of 
that southern area just as shoes are an encumbrance in Kerala. 

While we were in Brioni a sad and curious thing happened in a 
beach resort nearby. A newly-married German couple, on their honey- 
moon, went out to the beach in their swimming costumes with a basket- 
ful of snacks and plenty of beer. They were swimming and imbibing 
alternately. Suddenly the girl said she was going in for another swim 
and asked him to stay and finish his beer. The girl was soon attacked 
by a shark, and she yelled. All that the boy did was to take his camera 
with the telephoto lens and take pictures of the last agonising moments 
of the life of his “beloved.” As she disappeared under the w'ater, the 
young man sat down and finished his beer. An English-speaking 
member of Tito’s staff watched the incident from Brioni through his 
binoculars and then went to the beach resort and made enquiries.

My Days with Nehru 

Later he related the story. I said only a German could be so incradibly 
matter-of-fact. 

Gomel Abdel Nasser 

Nasser was another man to whom Nehru did not take to spontane- 
ously. But when Winston Churchill said at a meeting of the Common- 
wealth Prime Ministers’ Conference in London that Nasser was an 
usurper who seized power through violence, Nehru defended Nasser 
by saying that such a development was inevitable under conditions 
that obtained in Egypt, to overthrow an oppressive and corrupt regime 
and that Nasser had the support of the Egyptian people. 

After reading an auto-biographical book by Nasser, Nehru thought 
that Nasser was a light-weight and a rash and immature person. 
Nasser started with “positive neutrality” and ended up in non-align- 
ment. He always treated Nehru with deference as an elder and his 
mentor in many ways. 

When the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt took place after Nasser 
nationalized the Suez Canal, Nasser in desperation, sent for the 
Indian Ambassador in Cairo, Nawab Ali Yavar Jung, and told him 
that he had decided to go to the front sword in hand, engage in physi- 
cal combat and die in battle. The ambassador telegraphed to Nehru 
and requested him to send a message to Nasser asking him not to take 
the extreme step. Nehru at once sent a warm, friendly, and appealing 
message in a “most immediate” cable to Nasser through our ambassa- 
dor. American intervention, however, compelled the withdrawal of the 
Anglo-French forces and the need for Nasser to die in battle did not 
arise. 

The rather artificial coming together of Egypt and Syria and the 
formation of the United Arab Republic as the first step towards the 
achievement of Nasser’s grandoise and flamboyant design of a second 
Arab empire from Muscat to Morocco was bound to end in a wild- 
goose chase. When Syria, after a brief honeymoon with Egypt, broke 
away unilaterally, Nasser accepted the development with resignation. 
Nehru congratulated Nasser for his statesmanship in not using force 
to compel Syria to remain in the Union, even though Nehru knew that 
it was not possible for Nasser to do so. 

With experience Nasser had mellowed, but fate willed that Egypt 
shall have a new leader. 

Harold Macmillan 

Macmillan was the first British Prime Minister to visit India. He 



Some Foreign Dignitaries 


187 


arrived with his wife, Lady Dorothy Macmillan who is the daughter of 
the Duke of Devonshire., They stayed in the Prime Minister’s House. 
I had met Macmillan a few times at the Commonwealth Prime Minis- 
ters’ Conferences. 

When Churchill retired, R.A. Butler was superseded and Eden was 
chosen as the Prime Minister. Many people in England, including Nye 
Bevan, believed that Butler had more brains in his shoes than Eden had 
in his head. But in politics everything does not go by brains. In 1923 
most people had thought that King George V would send for Lord 
Curzon and appoint him as Prime Minister of Great Britain. But, on 
the recommendation of the outgoing Prime Minister, the King sent 
for Stanley Baldwin, then almost unknown in the Conservative party, 
and handed over the seals of office to him. In normal times brilliance 
is at a premium in British public life. When Eden had to go on account 
of the Suez imbroglio, Butler was again ignored and Macmillan was 
chosen to succeed Eden. Choosing of the leader of the Conservative 
party in the House of Commons by election was introduced only after 
the tenure of Sir Alexander Douglas-Home as Prime Minister; and 
Edward Health was the first one to be elected. 

Macmillan was a noted liberal among the Conservatives. While in 
India Nehru, among other matters, discussed with Macmillan at length 
the liberation movements in Africa and the desirability of ensuring 
orderly change in the continent. Nehru said that he saw no advantage 
for the colonial powers in prolonging the agony, and added that, if the 
British took the initiative other colonial powers were bound to follow 
suit. This obviously had some effect for, within a short time, Mac- 
millan visited Africa and made the most celebrated speech of his 
career — “the wind of change in Africa.” 

Unconsciously Macmillan had copied some of the gestures and man- 
nerisms of Winston Churchill. Imitation is the best form of flattery. 

While in Delhi Lady Dorothy Macmillan used to get ready early. 
Whenever she spotted me in the garden in the early hours of the 
morning, she invariably came out. She would ask for the names of 
plants and trees. She w’as fascinated by the tree Corissia Malabarica 
which was then in bloom — full of beautiful pink flowers in the shape 
of a mixture of lily and orchild. Originally from Kerala, Delhi has 
plenty of that tree now. Earlier U. Nu, Prime Minister of Burma, also 
got fascinated by the tree and we arrangad to send with him to 
Rangoon a few of the plants in pots. 

Macmillan spotted in my study the small sculpture of a woman in 
stone from a very ancient ruined temple in Mayurbunj (Orissa) pre- 
sented to me by Governor Sukthankar. He was fascinated. He admired 



188 


My Days with Nehru 


it so much that after breakfast next morning I sent it to his room as a 
present. Within minutes he was in mj’ study holding the sculpture as a 
treasure. He thanked me profusely still fondling the sculpture in both 
his hands. He sat down and asked me about its antiquity. I told him it 
belonged to the 8th century AD. That put up the value of the sculpture 
in bis mind. He told me to which firm in London he was going to 
send the sculpture to be mounted and where exactly in his own house 
he was going to keep it. As a Scot he perhaps knew the price of every- 
thing but I felt sure he also knew the value of most things. He said that 
generally the climate of a country determined its art forms; in a cold 
country like England art expressed itself predominently in the form of 
painting, while in Greece, Italy and India it was predominently sculp- 
ture. 

Konrad Adenauer 

Adenauer was one of the statesmen who impressed me considerably 
— next only to Winston Churchill. Tall and erect, he never used spec- 
tacles till his death in ripe old age. As an opponent of nazism he 
suffered under Kilter’s regime. He had to work as a mason for his 
living. Elected as Mayor of Cologne after the collapse of Hitler, he 
suffered insult from the army in occupation of the British sector. An 
arrogant major in the British army dismissed Mayor Adenauer for in- 
efficiency. The same Adenauer was later described by Winston Chur- 
chill as the greatest German since Bismarck. In my first book I have 
quoted from Adenauer’s memoirs passages about Nehru. 

It is well known that during the war German cities suffered more 
damage and casualties by bombing than any in England or elsewhere. 
Several important cities in Germany with their industrial complex were 
reduced to rubble. After the war the Germans brought heavy machinery 
into the open, -crushed the rubble into paste and made bricks out of 
it on the spot. Work went on day and night in open air and the cities 
were rebuilt in an incredibly short time. When Nehru visited the 
Federal Republic of Germany in 1956, 1 could still see traces of damage 
in the cities of Cologne and Hamburg. 

The allied powers took away much of the industrial machinery 
from Germany as reparations. The result was that very soon the 
Germans had up-to-date factories, but the others like the British and 
the French added to their already outmoded stuff. 

In Bonn, Adenauer found lime to personally look after the rose 
garden in the grounds of the Chancellor’s House. He loved going in a 
motor boat on the Rhine and organized one such trip for Nehru. 



Some Foreign Dignitaries 


189 


Adenauer and a number of top industrialists and others joined the 
cruise. Lunch was served on the boat. In one of his talks with 
Nehru, Adenauer dealt at length on the need for developing “commu- 
nications” in a vast and varied country like India. Nehru did not 
grasp what Adenauer meant by “communications” and went on explai- 
ning our plans for developing railways, roads, air traffic, post and 
telegraph, ra.dio and tele- communications. What Adenauer meant by 
“communications” was “intelligence.” As Chancellor he had a large 
secret budget for this. 

At their first meeting Adenauer confessed to Nehru that until he 
met the tall Valerian Cardinal Gracias, he was under the impression 
that all Indians were short. 

Nehru’s attitude to Adenauer was governed by a good measure of 
reserve mostly because of the rigid Hallstein doctrine which, in effect, 
meant that the Federal Republic of Germany would cut off diplomatic 
relations with any country which established diplomatic relations with 
the “German Democratic Republic.” Nehru never extended an invita- 
tion to Adenauer to visit India. He, however, did invite, through 
Maulana Azad, Vice Chancellor Blucher who subsequently did. Blucher 
had been known as a friend of India for long. 

In 1962, 1 happened to be in Badgastein in the Alpine region of 
Austria for six weeks on my own. There I met a large number of 
Germans who had come for thermal cure. All the Germans I came 
across spoke of Adenauer with veneration as the man who, together 
with Ludwig Erhard, brought about the “German Miracle.” I found 
only one dissenter who was an old woman from Hamburg. She was a 
rigid and fiercely prejudiced Protestant. She, however, bad only one 
grouse: “Adenauer is a Catholic!” 

Nikita Khrushchev 

Until the quiet, urbane and dignified Marshal Nikolai Bulganin 
was placed on the shelf in 1958, he as the Prime Minister and the 
ebullient Nikita Khrushchev, the extrovert, as the First Secretary of 
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, were like two peas in the 
same pod. There was at no time any doubt as to who had the supreme 
power. But when the two visited England and India, which have parlia- 
mentary systems of government, it was Bulganin the Prime Minister 
who took precedence; when they visited any east European country it 
was the bouncing First Secretary who took precedence. 

At the first meeting, after the arrival of Khrushchev and Bulganin 
in Delhi, Nehru spoke to them at length giving them the philosophical 



190 


My Days with Nehru 


background of India’s approach to probleros, the essence of Gandhi’s 
teachings and how the present generation of Indian leadership was 
conditioned. At subsequent meetings India’s stand on the Kashmir 
question was explained and international affairs discussed. The talks 
were comprehensive but general. More than once Khrushchev turned 
to Bulganin and said that he was fascinated by the way the complex 
problem of the 500 and odd Indian rulers was peacefully solved. 
Repeatedly he spoke, with approval, of “pensioning off people.” 

Several times Khrushchev emphasised the need for a first-class air- 
craft industry for a large country like India and volunteered to send 
some of Soviet Union’s best experts in the field. Some how it did 
not register with Nehru and no follow-up action was taken. It was 
only after the Chinese invasion that we woke up to the grim realities 
and secured Soviet collaboration in the production of modern military 
aircraft. 

On the eve of Nehru’s visit to Calcutta with Khrushchev and Bul- 
ganin, he asked me if I was accompanying him. I declined, saying that 
risking life at one public meeting was enough for me. He remembered 
the incident and laughed. It happened soon after 15 August 1947 on 
Nehru’s first visit to Calcutta as Prime Minister. I accompanied him on 
that trip and went with the Prime Minister from Raj Bhavan to the 
Calcutta maidan. While walking to the dais I was following Nehru. 
There was a mad rush. I fell down and was trampled by hundreds of 
feet. I said to myself ‘ what a way to die.” However, I caught hold of 
the coat of someone and managed to get up. On the dais Nehru saw 
me in bad shape. Later he discovered what happened. He told me that 
in a crowd I should be in front of him and should never follow him. 
The attendance at the meeting he addressed that day was estimated at 
one-and-a-half-million — the largest so far assembled anywhere in 
India. 

The crowd at the meeting addressed by Nehru, Khrushchev and 
Bulganin was incredible. It was estimated at four million — the largest 
assemblage of humanity in history anywhere in the world. It was an 
upheavel the like of which is unlikely to recur. 

A record of this incredibly vast concourse of people was caught in 
the camera of an enterprising man, in its entirety. The American 
camera correspondent of TIME and LIFE, who was well-known to me, 
did the trick. He was an artistic man with a keen sense of history. I had 
instructed the Chief of Security in Delhi to see that the American 
photographer was given all the facilities in Calcutta. He surveyed the 
Calcutta maidan the day before the meeting and found a tall tree some 
distance away from which he could survey the entire scene. On the day 



Some Foreign Dignitaries 


191 


of the meeting he took his position on the tree, armed with a camera 
fitted with a powerful tele-photo lens. After Nehru, Khrushchev and 
Bulganin arrived at the meeting and Nehru started speaking, the 
American took the photograph of the meeting section by section. He 
took the negatives to New York to be developed. After he returned 
to India, he brought for me, as a present, a copy of this remarkable 
photograph six feet long and one foot wide. I had it suitably framed 
and kept it with me for well over 20 years. Then I handed it over to 
the Administrative Secretary of the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial 
Fund to be passed on to the Nehru Museum and Library in the hope 
that it would be well preserved for posterity. 

Before a lunch party for Khrushchev and Bulganin at the Prime 
Minister’s House, all the servants and mails of the PM’s house 
assembled downstairs with marigold garlands in their hands to greet 
the distinguished visitors. It was a spontaneous gesture. Nehru was 
impressed by this and said the next day that the gesture took place as 
the servants felt that Khrushchev and Bulganin were the benefactors 
of the poor. I told Nehru that I had a hunch that at the lunch for the 
British Queen the enthusiasm and attendance of servants and the 
number of marigold garlands would perhaps be more. He growled at 
me. Actually, what I said happened when the Queen came to lunch. 
I do not know that conclusion Nehru drew at that time, for I was not 
there then. 

Khrushchev had a weakness for cashewnuts. Mangoes and cash- 
ewnuts were sent to him in Moscow every year by the Prime Minister 
as was done to some other foreign dignitaries. 

Nehru’s visit to the Soviet Union in 1955 and the visit of Khrush- 
chev and Bulganin to India well and truly laid the foundations for a 
fruitful relationship between the two countries. Khrushchev remained 
as one of the best friends of India ever since. 

During my association with Nehru, I had occasion to meet many 
other dignitaries also such as Chou En lai, U. Nu of Burma who 
possesses the most serene face I have seen, the flamboyant President 
Soekamo and Sultan Shahriar of Indonesia, Emperor Hirohito and 
Prime Minister Kishi of Japan, M.A. Jinnah, Sir Don Senanayake, 
Sir John Kotelelawla, Dudley Senanayake and S.W.R.D. Bandernaike 
of Ceylon, Joseph Chiefly and Sir Robert Menezis of Australia, King 
Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, the Kings of 
Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Tage Erlander of Sweden, Queen 
Juliana of the Netherlands, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II, 
Earl Attlee, Sir Anthony Eden, De Valera of Ireland, President Tru- 
man, and President Eisenhower. I shall not attempt to write about 



192 My Days with Nehru 

them and needlessly prolong this chapter. In my first book I have 
written about Winston Churchill. 

All the dignitaries I had met were vastly dwarfed while I was in the 
presence of Albert Einstein and I myself was reduced to nothingness. 
This great genius — scientist, philosopher and humanist — did not 
inherit one of the much maligned traits of his gifted race— the love of 
money. After he left Nazi Germany and took up residence at Prince- 
ton University in the United States, he was embarrassed by the salary 
he was given, by no means a very large sum then, and asked “what 
can I do with all this money?.” In his presence I instinctively felt the 
grandeur of his simplicity and the awsomeness of his humility and 
remembered the words of Jesus Christ about Nathaniel “behold an 
Israelite in whom is no guile.” 



24 An Unusual Hotel in Picturesque Surroundings 


In the autumn of 1957 Prime Minister Nehru paid a goodwill visit“to 
Japan. Some years earlier President Rajendra Prasad had made an 
ofBcial tour of that coimtry. 

The Japanese were aware of the fact that before and during World 
War II Nehru was an uncompromising and outspoken opponent 
of Japanese imperialism and militarism; but they also knew that 
Nehru made a distinction between the fascist government of Japan 
and the Japanese people. 

Three gestures of Nehru in the postwar period, while Japan was 
treated as an international outcaste by most nations, touched the 
Japanese people. They were: 

(1) India’s refusal to take war reparations from Japan. 

(2) The speed with which India concluded the Treaty of Peace and 
Amity. India was the first country to do so, formally terminating the 
state of war. 

(3) Sending an elephant to Tokyo for the Japanese children. This 
perhaps moved the Japanese people much more than anything else. 

Wherever we went, the Japanese people referred to these gestures 
with gratitude and warmth of feeling. 

It was while we were in Tokyo that the Soviet Union surprised the 
world by announcing the news of its putting a sputnik into orbit to 
circle round the earth. 

During this tour of Japan, the Japanese Ambassador to India, in 
the course of informal conversations with me, asked “will you be 
offended if I say that Nehru has done some harm to India by follow- 
ing policies which created an over-size image of India on the world 
stage which could not be sustained by internal realities?” I said that 
from the early thirties onwards some regimes ruined their countries by 
following policies backed by illusions of “indestructible internal 
strength,” He realised that I was referring to Germany and Japan. I 
drew his attention to the fact that governments of the world attached 
enormous importance to the Pope primarily because his word carried 
weight with millions of people, and that only Stalin asked “how many 
divisions has he got?.” The fact that Nehru had spent his life working 
for a great cause and suffered in the process, and was recognised as 



194 


My Days with Nehru 


Gandhii’s heir, had invested him with great moral authority. In Asia 
and Africa particularly he had become a symbol of man’s quest for 
freedom and independence. And he happened to be the Prime 
Minister of a potentially great country with strategically important 
geographical position. All these compelled millions of people every 
where to listen to him with attention. Ever since India’s independence 
Nehru never ganged up with others in the game of power politics. His 
activities on the international stage had been confined to peace and 
human freedom everywhere. We in India were aware of the inevitabi- 
lity of the next Prime Minister finding his level on the international 
stage more or less conforming to “internal realities.” 

Prime Minister Kishi and Foreign Minister Fujiyama, as a special 
gesture, took Nehru and party to Hakone for a. week-end. It was a de- 
lightful mountainous place and we stayed in a homely hotel where 
rooms were not numbered but bore the names of flowers. Nehru’s 
room was called “chrysanthemum,” Indira’s room was called “Lily of 
the Valley” (Indira was pleased with the name), N.R. Pillai’s was 
“Syp Japonica Thunb,” mine was “holly-hock,” another was lotus 
and yet another was carnation. Hakone is famous for growing the 
world’s largest and most luscious strawberry. Some are as much as 
four inches in length. These strawberrys are grown on the gentle sunny 
slope of a particular hill. After dinner all the participants sat around 
and autographed the printed menu cards for each other. 

While in Tokyo I saw a large number of people in the streets with 
their mouths covered with white cloth. In all innocence I told Ambas- 
sador Jha that, while I was aware of Buddhist influence in Japan for 
centuries, I had never heard that Jainism had spread to Japan. He 
laughed and told me that those people had covered their mouths be- 
cause they had flu and they did not wish to spread contagion. He 
added that the Japanese had a highly developed civic sense. 

At a reception on the eve of our departure from Tokyo for Hiro- 
shima and Nagasaki, the Canadian Ambassador asked N.R. Pillai, 
Secretary- General of the External Affairs Ministry, if the Prime 
Minister was going to issue a declaration to the world from Hiroshima 
against the use of the nuclear bomb. He said that the Canadian 
representative to the UN in New York Had informed him that Krishna 
Menon had strongly recommended it and was expecting advance copy 
of the declaration to be released in New York. On our return to the 
Guest House, while Pillai was relating to the Prime Minister the 
Canadian ambassador’s talk, I received, through the embassy, a cypher 
telegram from Krishna Menon. It was a sentimental message advising 
the Prime Minister “you and Indu should take the utmost precaution

at Hiroshima and Nagasaki against radio activity” and appealing to the 
Prime Minister to issue from Hiroshima a declaration to the world 
condemning the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and warning 
against its repetition. He asked for the advance copy of the declara- 
tion for “effective” publicity by releasing it to the press in New York. 
I gave the telegram to the Prime Minister who handed it over to Pillai 
after reading. The Prime Minister was somewhat annoyed. He com- 
mented “does Krishna Menon think that only Indu and 1 will be 
affected by radio activity and not the others who accompany me? 
What does he mean by ‘utmost precaution’? He need not have sent the 
telegram because he had already conveyed it through the Canadian 
ambassador.” No reply was sent to Krishna Menon and no declaration 
was issued. 

While I am on the subject of Krishna Menon’s ways of function- 
ing, I might as well tell here the story of how Krishna Menon deprived 
India of the post of Secretary-General of the United Nations. 

During the latter part of his second tenure as Secretary-General of 
the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjold had expressed privately to a 
few his idea that the next Secretary-General should be an Indian and 
that, in his view, the best person would be B.K. Nehru. Adlai Steven- 
son spoke to B.K. Nehru about it, but the latter told Stevenson that 
he was not interested. B.K. Nehru, however, promised Stevenson that 
he would privately speak to Nehru and recommend another name. 
Stevenson made only one stipulation — that it should not be Krishna 
Menon. Soon after, B.K. Nehru visited India and spoke to the Prime 
Minister. B.K. Nehru suggested the name of Bhagwan Sahay. The 
Prime Minister thought that it was a good suggestion and agreed to 
keep it secret from Krishna Menon and also to include Bhagwan 
Sahay as a delegate to the UN General Assembly in order to let him 
be known personally at the UN Headquarters. However, when the 
Indian delegation was announced, Bhagwan Sahay’sname was not there. 
B.K. Nehru assumed that either the Prime Minister had forgotten the 
matter or was loathe to thrust Bhagwan Sahay on a reluctant Krishna 
Menon who was to be the leader of the delegation. 

Soon after, Dag Hammarskjold died in an aircrash (1961). The 
search for a new Secretary-General began. B.K. Nehru’s name was 
upper-most in the list of candidates. The Russians were not averse to 
him. In fact they sent word to him informally that he would have their 
support. In the meantime Krishna Menon did his utmost to create 
opposition to B.K. Nehru wherever he could. He spoke to B.K. Nehru 
and advised him against accepting nomination for election — all the 
time making it clear that it was in his interest to shy away. B.K. Nehru 



An Unusual Hold in Picturesque Surroundings

told Krishna Menon that this proposal was made to him even while 
Hammarskjold was alive and that he had told all concerned, including 
Prime Minister Nehru, that he was not interested. He added that there 
was no change in his position. Krishna Menon did not want to take 
any chances. He told Adlai Stevenson and some other important 
persons that B.K. Nehru would not be acceptable to India. This was 
done without clearance from the Prime Minister. 

Ultimately U. Thant emerged as the dark horse. ~ 

Krishna Menon’s insane desire to blot B.K. Nehru out of the 
reckoning reminds me of a story of an old multi-millionaires who 
lived in Chicago before the advent of the aeroplane. She had only one 
child — a girl who was married to a calculating young man. While the 
daughter and her husband were on a winter holiday in Florida, they 
received a telegram from the family lawyer in Chicago annoimcing the 
death of the old lady and asking for instructions if the body was to 
be cremated or buried. The son-in-law immediately replied “Do both; 
don’t take any chances!” 

If the candidate was Arthur Lall, Krishna Menon would have 
moved mountains to help him; but he had no' use for people like B.K.

25 The Chick of Magalur* 


I have written about Indira in my first book in which 1 had said “with 
all kinds of inquiry commissions functioning, I do not wish to write 
more about Indira at present. In a companion volume to this book, 
I shall write more.” In this book I have tried to fulfill that promise. 

Until she became the interim Congress President early in 1959, 
Indira enjoyed a well-deserved reputation as the one and only close 
relative of Nehru who did not exploit the Prime Minister’s position. 
She was reserved and retiring, and kept herself aloof from governmen- 
tal affairs. Her behaviour was correct and dignified. 

When Indira went abroad with the Prime Minister for the first time, 
Nehru personally paid her air-fare. It is the general practice of heads 
of states and heads of governments to take their wives or one of 
their daughters to function as their hostesses while travelling abroad, 
and their governments meet the expenditure. As I did not think it 
was any use mentioning it to the Prime Minister, I spoke to the 
Finance Minister and suggested that he might raise this matter in the 
cabinet as an unscheduled item. This was done, and the cabinet unhesti- 
tatingly decided in favour of it. But Nehru made it a rule that Indira 
should not be given any daily allowance. 

In the raid-fifties the Governor of Assam invited Feroze Gandhi to 
accompany the Prime Minister on his Assam visit and he accepted the 
invitation. Indira was annoyed at this. She told me that she did not 
want to be in the same room with Feroze Gandhi in the Raj Bhawan. 
She tried to get out of the trip by advancing some excuse but her 
father wouldn’t hear of it. Ultimately she had to go. 

On the 20 June 1954 on her return Irom Mashobra (Simla; with the 
Prime Minister, Indira spoke to me about her wish to make a change 
in Nehru’s draft Will which read “My daughter and only child, Indira 
Priyadarshini, married to Feroze Gandhi, is my sole heir, and I beque- 
^ath to her all my property, assets and belongings.” She wanted to 
delete the words “married to Feroze Gandhi.” I told her that the only 
person who could make such a suggestion to her father was herself. I 

*This chapter was written before Indira Gandhi was expelled from the 
Lok Sabha.

advised her against it and told her that what was written in the Will 
was a mere statement of fact at the time of writing the Will and it was 
not binding on the future. However, 1 admitted that the words “married 
to Feroze Gandhi” in the Will were superfluous. Finally I told her 
“there is no need for you to be bothered about it because your posi- 
tion is stronger than that of a Nair woman of Kerala in the matriar- 
chal system. All she has to do to get rid of her husband is to put his 
chappals out; and all you have to do is to put in a brief announcement 
in the newspapers.” She smiled and that was the end of the matter. The 
Will was signed by Nehru the next day as planned. 

My exit from the government coincided with Indira becoming the 
interim Congress President. She was worried about the vacuum crea- 
ted by my exit insofar as her father was concerned. That was the 
main reason for the early termination of her Congress presidentship. 
Her stewardship as Congress President was marked by two develop- 
ments: 

(1) Dismissal of the communist government undar E.M.S. 
Namboodiripad and the ordering the mid-term poll in the state by 
the central government. 

(2) Ending of the separate status of Bombay and merging the city 
with Maharashtra. 

Some communists alleged that Indira’s strong stand against them in 
Kerala was because of their attack on me earlier. 

On the eve of the election of Lai Bahadur’s successor in January 
1966 Rajinder Puri, a delightful humorist, a fearless man, and an 
interesting writer produced a cartoon with the caption “A Cartoonist’s 
View of the Favourite Faces” which I reproduce on the next page. 

When the toppling of governments became a game in India both by 
the former Maharani of Gwalior and later by Indira, V. K. Krishna 
Menon said that “toppling” like “badminton” was a game suited to 
women. He added that toppling started with Indira who instigated the 
overthrow of the Namboodiripad government in Kerala and that, 
since then, she had perfected the art. 

In the autumn of 1962, about six weeks before his exit from the 
government, Krishna Menon heard that Indira had thrown her weight 
against him. He said bitterly to a friend “ever since the Dalai Lama 
fled from Tibet and got assylum in India, that chit of a girl, Indira, 
who has emotional attachment to the godman, had turned against 
me.” 

When the first split in the Congress was imminent, Krishna Menon 





The Chick, of Magahir 


201 


told a member of the Congress Working C.ommittee from the south, 
who specialized as a fence-sitter and chose to be all things to all men 
(and a woman), “do something to patch up the differences. Indira is 
a foolish and hysterical woman who would ruin the country.” 

Speaking at a public meeting in Delhi on 1 1 October 1970, Krishna 
Menon mounted a scathing attack on Indira. He administered a warn- 
ing against democratic institutions being misused by political leaders 
to inject fascism and dictatorial elements in the country’s body politic. 
He pointed out that Hitler achieved dictatorial powers through slogans 
promising everything to everybody. He asserted “conditions in India 
today are worse than those of China under Chiang Kai-Shek.” He 
wound up by saying “this is the beginning of the end.” 

Kamaraj, who did so much to make Indira the Prime Minister, 
lived to regret his action bitterly. Sanjeeva Reddy had clearly warned 
Kamaraj against the choice. P.C. Sen, the Chief Minister of West 
Bengal, fully shared Sanjeeva Reddy’s view. On 30 June 1970, 
Kamaraj publicly confirmed this. He added that no Chief Minister, 
barring D.P. Mishra of Madhya Pradesh, had shown any enthusiasm 
for Indira. He also said that it took a great deal of cajoling and per- 
suasion to make the Chief Ministers and others to veer round his view. 
He 'added that his reasons for backing Indira were many. He had 
thought that, as one who had the advantage of watching Nehru deal- 
ing with the Congress and the government, Indira would have an 
in-built advantage. His fond hope that Indira “would attract votes like 
a magnet” was comprehensively belied at the 1966/67 general elections 
out of which the Congress emerged as a badly battered party. 

About his error in making Indira the Prime Minister, Kamaraj 
used to say in private “a big man’s daughter; a small man’s m istake.” 

On the 1 1 October 1969, Kamaraj lashed out against Indira at a 
meeting of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee in the following 
terms: 

It is true that I have been responsible for installing Mrs Gandhi 
twice as the PM. People now find fault with me for criticizing her. 
I had high hopes when I supported her candidature; but they were 
belied by subsequent events. It is like the Tamil saying — An 
attempt to make an image of Vigneshwara (Ganesh) ended up in 
creating a monkey. 

In September 1966 I had to meet Indira twice, at her request, in 
connection with certain assets she had inherited from her father. An 
important and close relative of Indira heard about the meetings and 



202 


My Days with Nehru 


questioned me. I told the person the facts. Then the person gleefully 
said “that at Dinesh Singh visits her for ‘consultations’ daily after 
dinner and she always receives him in her bedroom where she has put a 
working table as an excuse.” I told the person that Indira always had 
a working table in her bedroom ever since I had known her and that 
I was surprised that the person had not noticed it. I added “it is this 
type of false rumour spread by you and other vicious people and the 
foolish tendency of Dinesh Singh to give wrong impressions that have 
encouraged the vulgar posters, coupling Indira’s name with his, 
hundreds of which appeared all over New Delhi ond Old Delhi recent- 
ly. 1 refuse to believe there is anything in it.” Without disclosing the 
name of the important and close relative, I conveyed to Indira the story 
in a private letter dated 20 September 1966 in which I cautioned her 
“don’t ever forget that you are now the focus of attention and your 
position as a young woman is a most difficult one under the blessed 
Indian conditions.” No reply was called for; but she did send a reply 
dated 21 September 1966. I quote on next page the relevant extract 
from it. 

After Indira became directly involved in politics, she changed 
beyond recognition. What she lost most was truthfulness. A year after 
she became the Prime Minister, a prominent editor, who was a suppor- 
ter of hers and who had exclusive interviews with her periodically, 
told me “she is so bold that she can look straight into one’s eyes and 
tell a black lie.” She achieved remarkable success in this direction, and 
soon earned the reputation as a consummate liar. In her defence I 
might say that perhaps, like Lawrence of Arabia, she reached a stage 
where she tended to believe her own patent lies. There is no other 
explanation for her saying at several public meetings, after becoming 
the Prime Minister, that she. had often faced bullets in her life! About 
her jail term, she told an interviewer in 1969 “I was regarded as so 
dangerous that I wasn’t even given normal prison facilities.” Her one 
and only imprisonment was in Naini Jail in Allahabad for a brief 
period of 8 months and 2 days from the 11 September 1942 to the 13 
May 1943. Actually she was so harmless that the authorities released 
her. In jail she was with Mrs Pandit and her eldest daughter. They 
were all treated as “A” class prisoners, and they received special con- 
sideration. 

Several times during her Prime Ministership Indira publicly raised 
the alarm that some people were trydng to kill her. It was always the 
Jana Sangh. Perhaps she wanted to gather sympathy. When openly 
confronted by some Jana Sangh MPs she had to admit that she had 
no evidence in support of her allegation.

At a press conference at Aldur near Chikmagalur in Karnataka 
State on 4 November 1978 Indira said “we did not adopt forcible 
sterilization. It was Dr Karan Singh, the Health Minister, who^ 
strongly advocated forcible sterilization. He was implementing the 
family planning programme with his own ideas.” Karan Singh pro- 
mptly contradicted her by saying “Mrs Gandhi’s political stunt to find 
a scapegoat for the sins of her son would not deceive anybody.” And 
the General-Secretary of the CPI, C. Rajeshwara Rao, lost no time in 
saying “we had written strongly against the compulsory sterilization 
drive and she, as the Prime Minister, replied angrily, defending it.”^

My Days with Nehru 


Apart from the falsity of Indira’s statement, it is unbecoming for a 
person to take shelter behind a subordinate. If Indira was not lying, 
then she was advertising her importence as a Prime Minister to disci- 
pline or to get rid of a minister who flouted declared policies. How- 
ever, everyone knows that Sanjay was the real Minister for Family 
Planning and Karan Singh was content to be the “boneless wonder." 

Indira’s abject dependence on ghost-writers of indifferent quality 
often landed her in embarrassing situations. I shall cite two instances. 

Towards the end of May 1968, 1 happened to listen a radio speech 
of Indira in Melbourne during her tour of Australia and New Zealand. 
It contained references to the Himalayas and to the great moun- 
taineers of Australia. Everyone knows that Australia has produced 
great cricketers, swimmers and tennis players; but nobody has heard 
of great Australian mountaineers. Neither Indira nor her ghost-wri- 
ters knew that Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to conquer Everest, 
is a New Zealander and not an Australian. It would have been appro- 
priate for Indira to make that speech at the formal function in 
Wellington, New Zealand, where Sir Edmund Hillary was scheduled 
to be present. In the Melbourne speech Indira claimed that in her 
younger days she was a mountaineer. If staying in a house-boat in 
"Srinagar or a tent at Pahalgam or a house in some of the hill stations 
■qualifies her, then she is a mountaineer. 

In its issue of 12 April 1972 the London Times published promi- 
nently the following; 

The funny coincidence of Mrs Gandhi and a Pakistani Economist 
From Peter Hazelhurst 

Delhi, April 11: — Delhi businessmen have discovered that one of 
Mrs Gandhi’s recent important policy speeches on industry was 
based on an article by a Pakistani economist which appeared in a 
Hong Kong magazine in January. A close examination of the maga- 
zine and Mrs Gandhi’s speech shows that the economist’s article 
was used sometimes almost word for word by the Prime Minister. 
As an example, the economist, ‘Mr. Mahbub U1 Haq, while examin- 
ing economic theories of the subcontinent, wrote the following in 
the magazine INSIGHT, on January 12: “In my own country, 
Pakistan, the very institutions we created for providing faster 
growth and capital accumulation frustrated later on all our 
attempts for better distribution and greater social justice.” 

Two-and-a-half-months later, addressing the Federation of 
Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) Mrs Gandhi 
•declared “The very institutions we have created for promoting fas- 



The Chick of Magalur 


205 


ter growth and capital accumulation now seem to frustrate our 
attempts for better distribution and greater social justice.” 

Other parts of the article were barely disguised in the Prime 
Minister’s speech. For instance Mr Haq had also written: “Once 
you have increased your GNP producing luxury houses and cars it 
is not very easy to convert them into low-cost housing or bus trans- 
port.” Mrs Gandhi had this to say: “Once resources are committed 
to luxury goods it is not possible to convert them into commodities 
of mass consumption like bus transport or houses for the poor.” 

Mr Haq also wrote: “Development goals must be defined in 
terms of progressive reduction and the eventual elimination of mal- 
nutrition, disease, illiteracy, squalor, unemployment and inequali- 
ties.” The Indian Prime Minister said in her speech: “Development 
goals should not aim at the proliferation of consumer goods or ser- 
vices which benefit only a certain section, but must be defined in 
terms of progressive reduction and eventual elimination of squalor 
and inequality, of malnutrition and disease, of illiteracy and unemp- 
loyment.” 

Close study of what Mrs Gandhi said shows that she not only 
borrowed entire phrases from the article but in fact based her speech, 
on the underlying philosophy of the Pakistani economist. As one 
bemused industrialist commented today: “We bad accepted Mrs 
Gandhi's speech as an important policy statement, but I wonder if 
we can take it seriously if she merely copied it from an obscure 
magazine. In any event we seem to have a Pakistani economic 
adviser now.” 

One of the most unsavoury developments in Delhi from 1958 on- 
wards was the emergence of a semi-literate beared Swami Dhirendra 
Brahmachari, as a power to reckon with. He was expelled from the 
Kashmir valley by Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad on receipt of numer- 
ous complaints of misbehaviour with women who went to him for yoga 
lessons. In those days he was atall and attractive looking man. He arri- 
ved in Delhi penniless. Indira got him, as a gift, a new car from an 
automobile manufacturing firm. She roped in the unsuspecting Lai 
Bahadur, K.K. Birla and some others and formed a Trust for the pro- 
motion of yoga. Substantial sums were collected for the Trust, and the 
so-called Brahmachari started living in style. All this happened before 
the death of Nehru. After Indira became the Prime Minister, the 
Brahmachari’s stars were on the ascendant. His transition from a her- 
mit’s hut to the jet age was rapid. The flying Swami owned air-condi- 
tioned ashrams in Delhi and elsewhere with all the modern conveni- 



206 


My Days with Nehru 


ences, a jet plane and a sizeable block of shares in the Maruti enter- 
prise. He formed an important element in' Indira’s “kitchen cabinet” 
and later in the caucus and the mafia. Now he is facing charges of 
large-scale smuggling of foreign exchange and fraud. In Delhi h^e was 
known as Indira’s Rasputin. 

The populist phase of Indira’s political career began with the 1969 
split in the Congress and the subsequent nationalization of banks. 
Tongawallahs, scooterwallahs, shoe-shines and rally^vallahs were left 
with the definite impression that money in the banks was theirs for the 
asking. This was reinforced by the slogan “Garibi Hattao" during the 

1970 mid-term poll. Indira set in motion a whole lot of populist pro- 
grammes involving the total outlay of over Rs 1,500 crores between 

1971 to 1974 which missed their objectives and fueled inflation to un- 
precedented levels. When the colossal wasteful expenditure on some 
of the programmes began to attract adverse comments from the Con- 
troller and Auditor-General, the watchdog of public finance, Indira 
had a secret order issued to all Government Departments on 30 April 
1976 not to submit confidential files on policy questions to the C and 
A.G. of India and reinforced it by another secret order in September 
1976 covering both the centre and the states. This was calculated to 
forstall any stricutures on the management of government finances. 
These secret orders, which were objected to by the Attorney General 
Niren De, have recently been revoked by the Janata government 
thereby restoring the practice in vogue since 1955 when government 
departments were directed to make readily available to the audit offices 
files req'uired by them, while files marked “secret” were to be sent per- 
sonally to the C and A.G. or to the head of the aduit offices. 

Indira’s 42nd Constitution Amendment enacted in 1976 change 
the “prescribing authority” for the form in which accounts of the 
union and states are to be kept from the C and A G. to the President 
who was only to “consult” the C and A.G. In the 44th Constitution 
Amendment sponsored by the Janata government and recently passed 
by Parliament, the article relating to the C and A.G. has been 
amended to provide that the President would prescribe the form for 
the accounts of the union and the states “with the concurrence of the 
C and A.G.” 

If anyone has the patience to count the number of foundation stones 
laid by Indira and no further action taken on them from 1970 to the 
time of her ignominous exit early in 1977, the enormity of her fraud 
on the people will be evident. 

Indira’s populist programmes and the “Garibi Hattao" slogan which 
V K. Krishna Menon described as “promising everything to every-

body” provoked Rajinder Puri to produce a cartoon showing an ill- 
clad famished “garib'’ with folded hands asking Indira with her long 
nose “Please Madatn, can I get back Garibil I have been miserable 
ever since it was removed.” 

It is now known to many that during the emergency Indira appro- 
ached the CPI for support for a Constitution Amendment to charge 
the Parliamentary system of government to a Presidential system. 
Bans! Lai, the coarsest junglee among ministers, and little Sanjay took 
this up earnestly and resolutions were passed by the Congress Commi- 
ttees in Lucknow and Chandigarh demanding the conversion of Par- 
liament, which had already outlived its normal terms, to a Constituent 
Assembly for framing a new' Constitution. All this was aimed at per- 
petuation ot absolute power in Indira’s hands and to ensure eventual 
dynastic succession. 

It is relevant to give the sequence of some events: 

12 June 1975: The Allahabad High Court Judgment invalidating 
Indira’s election to the Lok Sabha and barring her from seeking elec- 
tion for six years. 

24 June 1975: Appeal to the Supreme Court perferred against the 
Allahabad High Court Judgement. 

25 June 1975: Emergency was clamped down, political opponents 
were arrested and censorship imposed. 

Before the Supreme Court could hear the appeal, the Constitution 
was amended to oust its jurisdiction altogether, nullifying the 
Allahabad High Court Judgment and wipe out the election law appli- 
cable to the case. Out of abundant caution the law was amended ret- 
rospectively and solely to resolve in her favour the issues of law raised 
in the case. 

5 August 1975: The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill was rushed 
through the Lok Sabha in a day. The Rajya Sabha passed it the next 
day. It received the president’s assent immediately. 

The Constitution 39th Amendment Bill was rushed through to come 
into force on 10 August 1975 — a day before the Supreme Court was 
to hear Indira’s appeal. It put the Amendment Act in the ninth schu- 
dule immune from judicial challenge and inserted Aricle 329-A in the 
Constitution. Petitions challenging one who is or becomes the Prime 
Minister were to be tried before a special forum which, however, was 
not specified. 

11 August 1975: Appeal came for hearing in the Supreme Court. 
The whole situation was best summed up by Chief Justice A.N. Ray 
of the Supreme Court in his judgment:

First, it has wiped out net merely the judgment but the also 
election petition and the law relating thereto. Second, it has depri- 
ved the right to raise the dispute about the validity of the election 
by having provided another forum. Third, there is no judgment 
to deal with and no right or dispute to adjudicate upon. Fourth, 
the constituent power of its own legislative judgment has valida- 
ted the election. 

Indira’s sense of guilt drove her at one stage to seek protection 
against criminal responsibility altogether. The 41st Constitution 
Amendment Bill, passed by the Rajya Sabha, purported to confer on 
the Prime Minister lifelong immunity for acts done before and during 
the tenure of office. The Bill was not proceeded with in the Lok Sabha. 

Soon after the Congress split in 1969 Indira gave the green signal 
to the Intelligence Bureau to probe party politics, investigate the 
activities of senior colleagues including ministers, import of expensive 
sophisticated gadgets for bugging and monitoring personal conversa- 
tions. During the emergency even the President was not spared from 
much transgressions. At the instance of Indira, the intelligence 
agencies also indulged in election forecasts for her party and also 
carried out constituency-wise surveys and investigating the loyalty of 
individual candidates before the allotment of party tickets to them. 

Although so far no record of the involvement of the Research and 
Analysis Wing (RAW) in internal intelligence operations had been 
found, it was widely believed that during the emergency period RAW 
was deeply involved. 

It was part of the Indira’s style of functioning to bypasss her senior 
colleagues and deal directly with their subordinates thereby under- 
mining the very basis of good administration. Brahmananda Reddy 
was bypassed, and for all practical purposes Om Mehta was the Home 
Minister. C. Subramaniam was bypassed by putting Pranab Kumar 
Mookerjee in charge of banking, income tax. Customs and Enforce- 
ment Directorate. Since both Brahmanand Reddy and C. Subramaniam 
are men without much political following, they meekly pocketed the 
insult. 

For many years as the Prime Minister Indira surrounded herself with 
a bunch of Kashmiris. At one time many people in Delhi used to refer 
to the Government of India as the Kashmir panchayat. When someone 
mentioned this to me, I asked him who comprised the panchayat. He 
replied thatthe full-time members were Indira, D.P. Dhar, P.N. Haksar, 
T.N. Kaul and P.N. Dhar and the part-time candidate meniberswere 
R.N. Kao of RAW, Om Mehta and Karan Singh. Indira’s principal

fund collectors were L.N. Mislira and P.C. Sethi both of whom were 
neurotic queer characters. During Mishra’s time there was a price for 
every licence and permit. Never before had corruption premeated so 
comprehensively among ministers. The fact that much of this black 
money was kept in high denomination currency notes by the Prime 
Minister herself speaks volumes for the rotten state of affairs of the 
Indira regime. Indira was fully aware of the value of money to buttress 
her political position. 

I shall not attempt to descirbe in detail here the murky happenings 
of the emergency and the period leading up to it. All these are well- 
known to people. They included: 

Using the Constitution to subvert the very Constitution. 

Declaration of emergency without a cabinet decision. 

The arrest and imprisonment of all important opposition political 
leaders and thousands of others under MISA. 

Imposition of censorship and the gagging of the press. 

Misuse of mass media for personal and partisan political ends. 

■ Trampling under-foot people’s liberties. 

Misuse of intelligence and police organizations. Income-tax de- 
partment and Enforcement Directorate and other organs of go- 
vernment for political intimidations, vendetta, and fund collections 
for the ruling party. 

Indira’s strenuous exertions for the advancement of her son Sanjay. 

Destruction of the independence of the judiciary. 

Ill-treatment and harrassement of officers who acted with courage 
and refused to kowtow to Sanjay and the caucus. 

Remorseless demolition of residential and commercial buildings 
of poor people. 

Savage excesses in compulsory sterilization of poor villagers. 

The 44th Constitution Amendment Act sponsored by the Janata 
government will stand out as the condemnation of Indira’s doings 
during the emergency and the period leading to it. 

The great political thinker Bhupesh Gupta of CPI propounded a 
profound genernal theory that what the people’s representatives decide 
need not be referred to the people. Has he forgotten all the glorious 
things the “people’s representatives” did from 25 June 1975 after 
locking up important opposition leaders, gagging the press and imposing 
dictatorship on the country? The CPI functioned as the jackal behind 
Indira. And this despicable mangy member of the pack, Bhupesh Gupta, 
was the lia'sion between his party and Indira while she was politically 
shaky— i.e., until 1970.- The go-between was the ex-communist

Nandini Satpathy. As Indira did not wish to give the impression that 
she was dependent on the CPI, she saw to it that Bhupesh Gupta’s visits 
to her were not logged in the register of the security staff or her eng- 
agement pad, thus ensuring secrecy. The same was the case with 
Dhirendra Brahmachari, another frequent visitor. Bhupesh Gupta also 
seems to have forgotten that the people by and large repudiated the 
work of their “representatives” during the emergency by their verdict 
in the 1977 general elections to the Lok Sabha. They followed this up 
later in the subsequent elections to the state legislatures. 

On 5 May 1978, Indira visited her son Sanjay in Tihar jail to which 
she had sent many, including the rajmatas of Gwalior and Jaipur, 
during the emergency. Sanjay was sent there for a temporary period 
by the Supreme Court, cancelling his anticipatory bail, with a view 
to preventing him continuing to bribe approver to turn hostile in 
a case in which he was charged with theft and other crimes. Indira 
told Sanjay “be brave, this is your political rebirth, and do not worry. 
Remember that me, my father, all have spent life in prison.” She ask- 
ed counsel Bhatia “you please see that Sanjay gets special treatment 
here. I do not want him to live with ordinary prisoners. This is a politi- 
cal conspiracy, I am afraid.” Such thoughts did not occur to her when 
the two Rajmatas were imprisoned there. This reminds me of the story 
of three Bishops — the Bishop of Winchester who was a married man 
with a philosophical bent of mind, the Bishop of Chichester who was a 
bachelor, and the Bishop of Manchester who was a married man. One 
day a young man came to the Bishop of Winchester with a long face 
indicating that he was full of personal troubles. The Bishop asked 
him “what is it that troubles you, my son”? The young man started 
narrating his tale of woe. The Bishop intervened periodically to say 
“it could have been worse.” The young man got disgusted after hearing 
this refrain, and left. He came for mental solace; what he got was 
irritation. He decided to wreak vengeance on the Bishop. After about 
a month the young man called on the Bishop early one morning. He 
knew that the Bishop’s wife had gone to Manchester. The Bishop 
asked the young man “what is it, my son?” 

The young man; I have bad news, my Lord. 

The Bishop: It could have been worse. 

The young man; The Bishop of Chichester was found dead 
in bed in the cottage in the grounds of the 
Bishop’s in house in Manchester. The cottage 
was struck by lightning; but nothing happened 
to the Bishop’s house.

The Bishop; It could have been worse. 

The young man: Yes, my Lord, it was worse. 

The Bishop: Proceed, my son. 

The young man: Your wife was also found dead in his bed. 

The Bishop 

(jumping up); WHAT? 

People do react differently when something affects them personally 
and are singularly unconcerned when a similar thing happens to a fellow 
human being. Such is life. 

Some people worry their heads off about Indira continuing to justify 
the imposition of the emergency and harp on its “gains.” What else 
can she do to keep herself afloat? She is totally insensitive and remorse- 
less. Henry Kissinger was right when he said that she was a cold-blooded 
woman. In comparison Kishan Chand, the Lt. Governor of Delhi who 
committed suicide out of remorse for his infamous part in the emer- 
gency, had some sensitiveness. She is hiding behind the theory “only 
the weak and the infirm repent,” But when a John the Baptist comes 
clad in a raiment of camel's hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, 
living on locusts and wild honey, crying in the wilderness and calling 
people to repentance, Indira might confess her sins and get baptised. 
Until then Oh ye people hold your breath. 

Some of the reactions to Indira’s success in the Chikmagalur by- 
election indicated consternation as if a terrific swarm of locusts was 
approaching or terrible plague had erupted. The only sensible reaction 
was that of M.N. Govindan Nair, leader of the CPI Group in the Lok 
Sabha. He ridiculed the people exaggerating the importance of Chik- 
magalur by-election as if the entire future of the country depended on 
it. He said that the Congress (I), which had retained its seat, had not 
gained or lost by the by-election except that Indira would replace a less 
' important member. 

If Indira had shown some boldness and contested the by-election 
in the Fatehpur parliamentary constituency in UP, or the by-election 
in the Samastipur parliamentary constituency in Bihar, and w'on, it 
would have had some political significance though it would not have 
led to the withdrawal of prosecutions arising out of the findings of the 
Shah Commission. 

Indira has tittle to contribute to her party by way of parliamentary 
skill. For the first time she will realise that as an opposition member in 
Parliament, ghost writers cannot help her or prop her up. As the 
Prime Minister she could read out ghost-writen statements and answers 
to questions prepared by ofiicials and feel profound. For the rest she 



The Chick of Magahir

did make only some angry assertions in raised voice. Nobody has heard 
her make a reasoned and persuasive extempore speech in Parliament 
or in any select assembly. Her party had already got a Leader of the 
Opposition in the Lok Sabha in C.M. Stephen who has more tin in his 
larynx than grey matter in his head. 

Indira’ ample manipulative capacity can be put to full use by her in 
an uninhibited manner as she is already the head of her political party. 
The chick of Magalur will be doing some good if she can manage to 
keep the Janata party in jitters lest it relapse into complacency. 

Indira’s purposeless visit to England in November 1978, which was 
described by the British media as “rehabilitation and resurrection visit,” 
has some lessons for Indian politicians. Indira behaved with complete 
lack of dignity as if she was visiting the “Paramount Power” to report 
on happenings in a Satrapy and to beg for personal support. She had 
forgotten that her masters were in India and no longer in Britain. Few 
Indians have completely shed mental slavery even after 31 years of in- 
dependence. The people of Indian origin in Southall and Birmingham 
are not Indian citizens but are foreign nationals. Instead of trying to 
enlist their support and sympathy, Indira could have gone to Rae 
Bareli, It is relevant to quote here a passage I wrote in my first book: 

Some time after the defeat of the Conservative Party in the general 
elections in Britain soon after the surrender of Nazi Germany in the 
Second World War, Winston Churchill visited the United States 
where he made the ‘Iron Curtain’ speech at Fulton. On his way back 
home he was asked by press-men in New York v/hat he thought 
of the Labour Government and its policies in Britain. His reply was 
at once dignified and eminently appropriate. He firmly told his 
questioners that, as Leader of the Opposition, he had ample forums 
in his own country to make his views known about internal matters. 
He refused to say anything more. 

Readers might compare this to the unbecoming utterances of Indira 
in England. But then, Winston Churchill was a big man proud of his 
country and its civilization and did not consider the mighty United 
States as the “Paramount Power” even though his mother tvas an 
American. 



26 Some Stalwarts 


Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan 

This giant of a man, Badshah Khan, about six feet six inches tall, 
towering over every one else in the Congress Working.Committee, was 
so gentle, so mild and so meek that it was difficult to believe that he 
belonged to the turbulent North-West Frontier. Appropriately called 
the Frontier Gandhi, he succeeded in organizing a disciplined body of 
men called the Red Shirts and in the seemingly impossible task of 
taming a turbulent people to take to the ways of non-violence in 
political action. It was an infinitely more difficult achievement than 
training the people of Gujarat who, under the influence of Jainism, 
could easily take to non-violent methods. 

Until about the end of 1945 the Muslim League was not strong in 
the Muslim majority areas such as the North-West Frontier, Sind, 
Punjab and Bengal. The Muslim League was a volatile force where 
Muslims were in a minority such as UP, Bihar etc. But, when the 
British intention of withdrawing from India became fairly clear, the 
situation changed radically, The insignificant strength of the Muslim 
League in the provincial legislatures in the Punjab, Sind and the 
North-West Frontier no longer reflected Muslim public opinion. The 
position of the nationalist Muslims and others who were opposed to 
the Muslim League became embarrassing. They were facing an 
avalanche putting to severe test their faith in secularism and the unity 
of India. They had to face hostile Muslim mobs hurling abuse at them 
and calling them traitors. Every where the British rulers encouraged the 
Muslim League in whatever way they could. 

At the ill-fated Simla Conference called by the British Cabinet 
Mission in April 1946, M.A. Jinnah shook hands with Nehru and 
Patel but scornfully turned away from the outstretched hands of 
Maulana Azad and Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan. Muslims in the 
Congress were a provocation to Jinnah who considered them as 
stooges. 

The Congress Working Committee at its meeting on 2 June 
1947, accepted the Mountbatten Plan of partition. At that time the 
Congress leaders were concerned about its “betrayal” of the North-

West Frontier. At the meeting only Gandhr and Khan Abdul Gaffar 
Khan stood out clearly against partition. At the request of Khan 
Abdul Gaflfar Khan both Congress President Maulana Azad as well as 
Gandhi approached Lord Mountbatten to ascertain if the referendum 
in the North-West Frontier could include the alternative of inde- 
pendence as well. The Viceroy could easily silence them by the argu- 
ment that Nehru was strongly against the grant of independence to 
any province and that he had agreed to the referendum in the North- 
West Frontier, as in Sylhet, as part of a larger plan. 

Nehru urged the Khan brothers to prepare to go through the re- 
ferendum on the sole issue of accession to India or Pakistan. He said 
that even if the Congress lost by a narrow margin, it could renew the 
struggle later. 

Taking note of the Congress complaint that Governor Sir Olaf 
Caroe was a Muslim League partisan, Mountbatten replaced him with 
General Lockhart with a view to ensuring fair election. The North- 
West Frontier Congress under the leadership of Khan Abdul Gaffar 
Khan, however, decided to abstain from the referendum. Only 289,244 
(i.e 50.49 per cent) of the total electorate of 572,798 voted in favour 
of Pakistan, with 2,874 against, 

Nehru did some wishful thinking on more than one count: • 

(1) That there was a fair. chance of the Congress winning the 
referendiun in the North-West Frontier, in which case the bottom 
out of the demand for the creation of Pakistan would be knocked 
off. 

(2) Even if the Congress lost by a narrow majority, the Congress 
in the North-West Frontier could renew the struggle later. 

To any objective person the chances of the Congress winning the 
referendum were remote. If the Congress joined the battle, the percent- 
age of votes in favour of Pakistan was most likely to have been very 
much larger. Even if the referendum went in favour of India, Pakistan 
would have come into existence. And the North-West Frontier outside 
the gambit of Pakistan would not have survived for long. East 
Pakistan survived for about 24 years; but North-West Frontier would 
not have survived for 24 months. 

The absurdity of Nehru’s hint that even if the Congress lost the re- 
ferendum by a narrow margin, the struggle could be renewed later 
has been made amply clear by what happened to Khan Abdul Gaffar 
Khan and his Red Shirt Movement during the past 30 years. 

Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan has been accused of timidity and even of 



216 


My Days with Nehru 


cowardice. It is obvious that he was so obsessed with “absolute” non- 
violence that he did not want to put that preciops commodity to test. 
It is also quite likely that he had a more realistic sense of Muslim 
public opinion in the North-West Frontier at that time than Nehru 
and others. 

It has been said that the meek shall inherit the earth. This did not 
happen in the case of Khan Abdul Gaifar Khan— may be because he 
clung to an abstraction and failed to act. This reminds me of the story 
of a man who had read in the scriptures “throw your bread upon the 
waters, and it shall return to you ten-fold.” He acted on it and later 
told a cynical priest “I put a loaf in a water-proof polythene bag and 
threw it on the wafers. I had taken the precaution of attaching a string 
to it in case the almighty forgot his promise. I spent the whole night 
on the river bank. By the morning nothing happened; so I drew it 
back and went home disappointed.” The priest told him wryly “if you 
had not used the polythene bag, water would have soaked into the 
bread which would then have weighed ten times!” 

Fate and circumstances made this great and good man Khan 
Abdul Gaffar Khan a tragic figure of the sub-continent who spent 
most of his life, after partition, in prison or in exile. A worse fate be- 
fell that fine jovial man with a cherubic face Khan Abdus Samad 
Khan known as the Baluchi Gandhi who was brutally murdered. 

Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan deserves the veneration and salutes of the 
Indian people, but conferring on him the Nehru award for interna- 
tional understanding was a thoroughly misplaced gesture. Between 
Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and “international understanding” there was 
nothing common. 

AcharyaJ.B. Kripalani 

Of the many types of Congressmen the Gandhian era threw up, 
Acharya Kripalani was unique. The prefix “Acharya” does not mean 
that he is a Brahmin. It stuck to him because he was a teacher. All 
Sindhis whose names end with “ani” are Kshatriyas. The Sindhi 
Kshatriyas are successful businessmen; but dada Kripalani, who richly 
deserves the prefix “Acharya,” remained a delightfully unbusiness- 
like and disorganized person. In the simplicity of personal life he 
stuck to the severest of Gandhian standards. He was one up on 
Gandhi in the practice of Brahmacharya. Gandhi adopted Brahtna- 
charya after producing several children. Kripalani was a Brahmachari 
throushout. To many, who were not in tune with Gandhian ways, 
Kripalani’s marriage was a joke. .A prominent Congressman once 



Some Stalwart’; 


217 


told me that he never understood the meaning of platonic love until 
he came to know of the relationship between Kripalani and his wife 
Sucheta. 

Acharya Kripalani was never known to be communal, parochial 
or sectarian. Neither has he shown any fanaticism about imposing his 
fads on others. He is a liberal person with flexibility of mind. 

Soon after independence there was an essay competition in a Delhi 
college. Students were asked to write short sketches of any one of the 
national leaders of their choice. One student found Acharya Kripalani 
an interestig subject of study. He wrote a piece which was a remark- 
able exercise in brevity. 1 quote below what he wrote; 

With thinning long hair resting on his shoulders, this tall man 
with a lean and hungry look, small but piercing eyes and a nose 
like an eagle’s beak, with a flowing plain shawl over his shoulders, 
reminded me of Caius Cassius, the Roman General and Senator. 
He believes in plain living and low thinking. He is so independent, 
cantankerous and free from fear that he is capable of attacking all 
other leaders except Gandhi. 

This reminded me of an incident in the life of that great incisive 
scholar, ecclesiast and pessimist the Very Reverend Dr William 
Ralph Inge, who, as Dean of St Paul’s from 1911-34, earned the 
sobriquet ‘ the gloomy dean.” Incidentally, his name does not rhyme 
with “cringe” but with “sting.” While he was Assistant Master at 
Eaton (1884-88), Queen Victoria visited the famous Public School. 
A boy from the school was chosen to welcome the Queen at the solemn 
function. Dean Inge sent for the boy and told him “it is a great 
honour to have been chosen to make the welcome speech. While it is 
entirely for you to compose the speech, I decided to leave some 
thoughts with you. Avoid the temptation of using superlatives like 
‘when the Queen comes, it is sunrise,’ and ‘when the Queen goes, it 
is sun-set.’ Be deferential. Above all be brief and matter of fact.” The 
young boy was impressed by the advice. At the appropriate time the 
young brat got up smartly and made his welcome speech. He said “we 
are grateful to Her Majesty the Queen for finding the time to visit our 
school. Of Queen Victoria the less said the better.” 

Acharya Kripalani had the gift of eliciting the loyalties of younger 
people working with him and dealing with them as if they were his 
equals. And he took a fatherly interest in all the young women W'ork- 
ing with his remarkable wife. He took keen interest in match-making. 
He once decided that a nice Madras Brahmin girl working with 



218 


My Days with Nehru 


Suchela should marry me. Without any reference to me he wrote to 
the father of the girl in Madras. The latter wrote to me giving his 
consent. It caused me much embarrassment. The disaster for the girl 
was averted by my remaining unresponsive! 

Ever since I joined Nehru in Allahabad early in 1946 I had felt that 
Kripalani and Nehru were antipathetic towards each other. Kripalani 
was prone to make cynical and sarcastic comments about Nehru to 
others. Kripalani was very much a part of the “old guard’’ which did 
not see eye to eye with Nehru on anything except India’s freedom. 
When, later in the year, Nehru became Congress President the un- 
broken tenure of 12 years of Kripalani’s General-Secretaryship of the 
AICC was broken. But Nehru took him into the Congress Working 
Committee. 

When Nehru gave up Congress Presidentship, after entering the 
interim government in September 1946, Acharya Kripalani was 
nominated by the Congress Working Committee as the Congress 
President. He took over that office on 15 October 1946. Kripalani 
failed to realise that the position of the Congress President changed 
with Nehru and Patel in the government. They, together with Sardar 
Baldev Singh representing the Sikhs, continued the negotiations with 
the Viceroy and the British. Even Maulanfi Azad went out of the 
picture. Kripalani w'as never before, associated with the negotiations 
with the British Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy. Kripalani’s stand 
that the Congress President must be consulted on all important 
matters could lend itself to the interpretation that Gandhi should not 
be consulted on anything because he was neither a member of the 
Congress Working Committee nor even a four-anna member of the 
Congress. Kripalani’s disclosure that Nehru told Gandhi “I will be 
damned if I consult Kripalani” is correct. However, the Congress 
President came into the picture as all important matters w'ere discussed 
in the Congress Working Committee. 

As a special gesture Nehru got the agreement of the new Viceroy 
Lord Mountbatten to include Kripalani as the third member of the 
Congress Delegation (along with Nehru and Patel) for formal discus- 
sions with the Viceroy. Thereupon Jinnah, who always claimed parity 
with the Congress, had one more member added to the Muslim League 
delegation. 

In the face of the growing awareness that the position of the 
Congress President would no longer be the same as before, and the 
fact that Nehru held the firm view that the historic role of the 
Congress was finished w'ith independence, Kripalani resigned from the 
Presidentship in November 1947.

In. the chapter “Postscript” in my first book,' referring to 
M.R Masani’s book “Bliss was it in that Dawn” I made an errone- 
ous statement that after 1941 Rajendra Prasad was never the Congress 
President. The Congress Working Committee did appoint Rajendra 
Prasad as the interim Congress President in November 1947. to fill the 
vacancy caused by the resignation of Acharya Kripalani. Rajendra 
Prasad vacated that position after a brief period when Pattabhi 
Sitaramayya was elected as the Congress President. 

It was during the Presidentship of Pattabhi Sitaramayya that the 
suggestion of Nehru that term “ Rashtrapati" be exclusively reserved 
for the President of India and should no longer be used by the 
Congress President was accepted by the Congress Working Committee. 
Pattabhi never objected to this change by arguing that it amounted to 
denigrating the ofiice of Congress President. 

It might be mentioned in this connection that from 1946-64, while 
Nehru was at the helm in the goverraent, no Congress President — not 
even Kamaraj— counted for anything more than what Kripalani did. 
It is, however, true that after Nehru the position of Kamaraj as 
Congress presidant and the functioning of the party machine acquired 
a Tammany Hall flavour until Indira asserted herself and split the 
Party. This phase might be treated as an aberration. 

After his resignation from Congress Presidentship and the death of 
Gandhi, Kripalani drifted. He left the Congress and joined the newly- 
formed KMPP and finally became a non-party man. 

Kripalani has the distinction of being one of the few who declined 
to accept a Governorship. Once he got elected to the Lok Sabha as 
an independent from a constituency which was left uncontested by the 
Congress at the instance of Nehru. On a later occasion he contested 
against V.K. Krishna Menon and got defeated. Almost immediately 
afterwards he contested a by-election from UP and won defeating the 
Congress candidate — giving the lie to Indira’s foolish boast that even 
an ordinary Congress volunteer could defeat Kripalani. 

Acharya Kripalani is such a fearless man that he would never do 
anything or refrain from doing anything with an eye on personal gain. 
In fact such thoughts never entered his head. 

S.K. Patil 

S.K. Patil was a protege of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel who used him 
as a tough to handle the diflicult metropolitan area of Bombay. Sardar 
Patel knew the art of using widely different types of people. When a 
prominent Congress politician of Kerala was privately asked by a well- 



220 


My Days with Nehru 


wisher why he was using and supporting a particular person who was 
an unreliable and unpopular bossy type, he asked the question “is any 
one rearing chicken for the love of chicken?” Sardar Patel supported 
Patil to the hilt as long as he was alive. Patel was not unaware of 
Path’s faults. To all the detractors of Patil, Patel’s answer was “find 
me another who will be as effective in Bombay as Patil.” 

Nehru kept Patil at a distance. Rajaji, who was Home Minister 
after Sardar Patel, suggested to Nehru that Patil might be taken into 
the cabinet. Nehru was not enthusiastic. However, he wrote to 
B.G. Kher, the Chief Minister, and to Morarji Desai, the Home 
Minister of Bombay private letters asking for their opinion. Both 
opposed the idea. Morarji’s letter was brutally frank; I shall avoid 
creating trouble between Morarji and Patil by not publishing the 
photostat of the letter. Nehru dropped the idea. 

After Patil’s strong support for the Government of India’s decision 
to exclude Bombay City from Maharashtra under the states reorgani- 
zation scheme. Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant thought that it was no 
longer appropriate to keep Patil out of the government. Pant pleaded 
with Nehru. It was only then that Patil could enter the government. 

In the accepted political sense Pntil was not a popular man. He 
loved the good things of life and made no secret of it. He broke social 
conventions wherever he could discreetly do so. He was an enemy of 
humbug and hypocrisy. He had ample respect for money and fully 
knew its manifold usefulness. He was never tortured by thoughts of 
ends and means. Neither was he ever assailed or vexed by ideological 
formulations. In private life he was the opposite of Morarji Desai. 

Patil is one of the liberated persons in the Congress. He is a cosmo- 
politan in a cosmopolitan city. He is not communal or narrow in any 
sense. Maharashtrians generally dislike him; but Gujaratis are indulg- 
ent to him. Industrialists and traders supported him. 

As a departmental minister, Patil was not a resounding success. As 
Minister for Food and Agriculture, Patil earned the reputation of 
having grown more foodgrains in the United Stales than in India. 

Patil was not free from ambitions. He loved to feel that he was in 
the reckoning among those in the running for Prime Ministership after 
Nehru. His long-term scheming and planning for it were faulty. He 
did not fully realise that money and Tammany Hall methods would 
not work. He refused to admit even to himself that he did not generate 
enough confidence in others. 

After Patil became cabinet minister, he made it a practice to spend 
the week-ends in Bombay for reasons which were obvious to those whn 
were in the know of things. When there was public criticism of it.

one of those who refuse to believe that speeding a car in a crowded 
city does not save time.’’ Dr Roy, Nehru and I were about to go to 
the Secretariat in Nehru’s car. I requested Dr Roy to speak to Nehru 
in the car. Dr Roy said “Jawahar, you know that Vallabhahi did not 
come to see you because he could not climb steps. I have also reached 
that stage and so has Govind Ballabh Pant. I have spoken to Mathai 
and I am arranging to have a small automatic electric lift installed in 
your house.” Nehru kept quiet. Dr Roy was a good psychologist. He 
asked the manufacturers to get in touch with me. Soon Nehru was go- 
ing abroad, and I took the opportunity to have the lift installed in his 
absence. After it became a fait accompli, Nehru almost regularly used 
the lift. 

Dr Roy was invariably a dinner guest at the Prime Minister’s House 
whenever he visited Delhi. On one such occasion he met the noted 
violinist Yehudi Menuhin and his wife. They were vastly impressed by 
him. They invited him to visit them in England whenever he was there. 
Dr Roy remembered this and met the Menuhins the next time he 
visited England. They liked him so much that they gave him the name 
“magnificent brigand.” 

One day Dr Roy, who looked depressed, spoke to me about his one 
great disappointment in life. It was about a brilliant young medical 
man Dr Susanta Sen who was popularly known as Budda Sen in Delhi. 
He had all the highest medical degrees England could offer apart 
from a post-graduate science degree- from Cambridge. The degrees 
formed an impressive array. He was tall, slim and handsome. I have 
heard many wealthy sophisticated women say “Budda Sen has the best 
bed-side manners in attending to sick women.” From London Budda 
Sen was brought to Delhi by Lady Linlithgow and during war-time he 
was posted to the Wiilingdon Nursing Home. After the war he resign- 
ed and set up private practice. He was an immediate success. Dr Roy 
had a fatherly interest in him. He had fervently hoped that Budda Sen 
would develop into India’s most illustrious medical man for which he 
was amply equipped. Soon Buddha Sen developed other interests. 
Punctuality, the hall-mark of a good doctor, deserted him. Availabi- 
lity, the ordinary virtue of a doctor, also deserted him. Driving from 
Agra to Delhi vvhile he was not sober, he bashed up his car, himself 
and a foreign girl. What emerged from the accident and subsequent 
hospitalization was the ghostly shadow of a once handsome man. His 
face wasirrepairably disfigured. Budda’s position in Delhi soon became 
untenable. He migrated to London where he set up practice in Harley 
Street and was destined to fail. Then he migratad to Canada and few 
have heard of him since.

West Bengal was fortunate in having a titan like Dr B.C. Roy at the 
lielm during a very difficuit period. Like the Punjab, West Bengal suf- 
fered grievously as a result of partition. Unlike in the Punjab, the 
problems in West Bengal continued to be a running sore. Perhaps the 
gifted people of Bengal deserved more consideration and assistance 
from the central government. It is sad to think that the great metro- 
polis of Calcutta has sunk to be the world’s most dismal city. But for 
Dr B.C. Roy, the position of West Bengal would have been much 
■worse. 

- People will remember Dr Roy as the last of the illustrious leaders 
Bengal has produced. He was one of the very few persons in India who 
would have filled any office with distinction and remained bigger than 
nny such office. 

M.K Roy (1893-54) 

It was a few months before his death that I came across M.N. Roy, 

J was aware of his backgro,und. A fellow Indian revolutionary, who 
knew Roy well in Europe, had told me an authentic story about Roy’s 
■first contact with Lenin in 1920. 

Roy left India in 1915 at the age of 22 and took part in revolution- 
ary movements in Mexico and Europe. He attended the Second World 
Congress of the Comintern in 1920. At the conclusion of the Congress 
Lenin told Karakhan, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister who was later 
liquidated in one of Stalin’s purges, pointing to M.N. Roy ‘ffiere 
is a young man who should be encouraged. His principal qualification 
is that he knows nothing. He is enthusiastic and he can be taught.” 

While in Berlin, M.N. Roy was a frequent visitor to the rooms of 
A.C.N. Nambiar. Roy was very fond of Indian food and could cook 
some Indian dishes with skill and imaginative improvization. 

A few months before Roy’s death, Nehru received a letter from 
Jayaprakash Narayan saying that M.N. Roy was ill and in desperate » 
need of financial assistance. Roy was then living with his wife Ellen in 
Dehra Dun. Nehru asked me to go to Dehra Dun to assess the needs. 

I informed Mrs Roy in advance about my visit and told her that I 
would also like to meet the doctor attending on her husband. After 
arrival in Dehra Dun, I met Mrs Roy first and then the doctor in her 
presence. I asked them to add up the bills pending for payment and 
to draw up an estimate of the financial needs for six months. When I 
met them the next morning, they gave me the figures. I told Mrs 
Roy that I had not asked to see her husband as I did not wish to put 



224 


My Days with Nehru 


any strain in him. She said he was aware of my presence in Dehra 
Dun and that he would be upset if I went away without seeing him. 
Then she took me into Roy’s room. He was in bed neatly dressed. A 
tall and handsome man, with a well-proportioned figure, he looked very 
leonine. I conveyed to him Nehru’s greetings and good wishes. He 
expressed his appreciation and gratitude to Nehru for sending me to 
enquire about his warm health. I told him that he should not worry 
about his treatment and requirements and that I had discussed all these 
matters with Mrs. Roy and his doctor. 

On reaching Delhi I made my report to Nehru and recommended 
a sum to cover the existing and future requirements for six months. He 
asked me to add a thousand rupees to the figure I recommended. A 
cheque for the amount signed by Nehru was forwarded by me to Ellen 
Roy with the assurance that after six months the position would be 
reviewed. 

No further financial assistance became necessary, for, the man, who 
had become a legend in his own life-time, passed away before the 
expiry of six months. 

S, Srinivasa Iyengar {1874-1941) 

Seshadri Srinivasa Iyengar, an outstanding Madras lawyer, was at 
one time the most important Congressman in the south. He belonged 
to the galaxy of eminent men and women in the Congress — Mofilal 
Nehru, C.R. Das, Vithalbhai Patel, and Sarojini Naidu. In 1926 he 
was elected Deputy Leader of the Swaraj party in the Central Legis- 
lative Assembly under Motilal Nehru. He presided over the Gauhati 
session of the Indian National Congress in 1926. S. Satyaniurthi and 
K, Kamaraj were his early disciples. 

Though a fiercely independent man politically and in many other 
respects, Srinivasa Iyengar was a singularly unlibcrated person in 
social habits. He comformed to the conventional and conservative 
behavioural pattern of the orthodox south Indian Brahmins. 

If imitation is the best form of flattery, then Srinivasa Iyengar was 
an admirer of Motilal Nehru within the limitations of his orthodoxy. 
Ever since Motilal Nehru returned from a visit to Europe and the 
Soviet Union in 1927, Srinivasa Iyengar was gripped, like the salmon 
and the Atlantic eel. by an uncontrollable impulse to go on a journey 
overseas, just because Motilal Nehru had done so. But Srinivasa 
Iyengar had not so far worn European clothes. He found three young 
sartorial advisers in Dewan Chaman Lai, Tulsi Goswami and Asaf Ali. 
They got ready for him the necessary clothes— three wollcn suits with 



Some Stalwarts

ties and socks to match, one black dinner suit with black tie and black 
socks, several white shirts, white collars, and two pairs of black shoes. 
Barring the dinner clothes, items in each set of clothes were given 
identical numbers. For example, if Srinivasa Iyengar picked up a tie, 
all he had to do was to look at the number and pick out all the rest 
bearing the same number in order to ensure that everything was 
matching. Dressing was thus made simple for Srinivasa Iyengar. He 
made the “westward ho” in 1928. 

In Berlin, Srinivasa Iyengar was looked after by the famous 
Chatto (Virendranath Chattopadhyaya) and his brother-in-law A.C.N. 
Nambiar — both fellow revolutionaries. Srinivasa Iyengar was a friend 
of Nambiar’s elder brother Professor Candeth in Madras. Chatto had 
high hopes of utilizing the visit of the ex-President of the Congress for 
the furtherance of India’s cause abroad. Within an hour, however, 
Chatto came to the conclusion that Srinivasa Iyengar was a man with 
outmoded ideas incapable of creating any impression in the west and 
that he had undertaken the trip simply because Motilal Nehru had 
done it. Chatto was so disappointed that he gave up the idea of escort- 
ing him to the Soviet Union and asked A.C.N. Nambiar to undertake 
that irksome task. After arranging with Champakaraman Pillai and 
Nambiar to take the distinguished guest from India to a “Variety 
Theatre,” Chatto told Srinivasa Iyengar that Nambiar and Pillai would 
be taking him to a typical “Aryan Cultural Show” in Berlin. The 
magic words “Aryan Cultural Show” generated in him a feeling that 
during that night he would be elevated to the recondite regions of 
sublime philosophical antiquity with incence-buming, blowing of 
conch shells, ringing of bells, chanting, and recitations from all the 
four Vedas. Champakaraman Pillai had purchased three tickets for the 
front row so that Srinivasa Iyengar could have an excellent view at 
close range. As the curtain went up, there came on the centre of the 
stage on a neat platform, from a sunken pit below, a bevy of shapely 
girls completely in the nude. His eyes glued to the scene, Srinivasa 
Iyengar asked Nambiar “why did you bring me here?,” and started 
craning his neck as the girls flitted about and at the same time asking 
questions such as “is this a cultural show?,” “do they have this every 
night?,” “why do the Germans like women so much?,’" and “why did 
you bring me here?,” And all the time he continued the craning exer- 
cise. Nambiar was amused and said “the Germans like women no- 
more passionately than Indians do. The difference is that the Germans 
do not indulge in double-think and practise hypocrisy as the Indians 
do. We can leave if you like.” Srinivasa Iyengar showed no inclina- 
tion to leave and continued asking questions “how long does it last?,” 



226 


d^Iy Days with Ncbnt 


and “for the next show will there be a dillerent set of girls?,” and the 
craning of the neck never ceased until the show was over in the early 
hours of the morning. 

The next evening Srinivasa Iyengar and Nambiar boarded the train 
for Moscow. When they crossed the German border into Poland, it 
was late in the evening and both Srinivasa Iyengar and Nambiar were 
already in their sleeping berths. There was a noise in the corridor 
shouting “Mr Iyengar, Mr Iyengar.” Soon a policeman knocked at 
the compartment. He asked Srinivasa Iyengar to get dressed and to 
follow him. Srinivasa Iyengar was visibly alarmed and asked Nambiar 
what had gone wrong. Nambiar said that he would accompany him. 
The policeman took them to an impressive-looking man in resplendent 
uniform. He looked like a Marshal. Before he could utter a word, 
Srinivasa Iyengar started a speech: “I am the Vice-President of the 
Indian Parliament, I am the ex-President of the Indian National 
Congress which conducts the struggle for India’s freedom. When you 
Poles fought for your independence, we Indians extended our sym- 
pathy. You Poles must now show sympathy for India’s freedom move- 
ment.” Srinivasa Iyengar would have prolonged his speech but for 
the intervention of the man in resplendent uniform by saying “Mr 
Iyengar, I am sorry to have caused you inconvenience. In the normal 
course your passport came to me for checking. I was impressed by 
your photograph showing you in striking attire and I had an irresisti- 
ble desire to see you. Now in your drab, though perfect, European 
dress you have disappointed me. To compensate you, I am issuing 
instructions to ensure that during the night no one enters your 
compartment. I hope you will have a tranquil night.” The passport 
photograph had shown Srinivasa Iyengar in Kurta with an “angavas- 
tram" (neatly-folded silver-bordered cotton shawl) hanging on top of 
it and a gold-bordered turban on his head. 

Srinivasa Iyengar woke up early in the morning while Nambiar, as 
was the practice with him, was still asleep. Srinivasa Iyengar saw some 
yellow flowers growing wild in large numbers. As he had heard that 
Motilal Nehru was fond of flowers, Srinivasa Iyengar decided to show 
Nambiar that he was no less fond of them. He woke up Nambiar and, 
pointing his linger out, asked him “what is the name of that flower?” 
Nambiar, who was never interested in gardening, knew the names of 
only three flowers not familiar in Madras. He made a quick guess and 
replied “daffodil.” By the time they were within fifty miles of 
Moscow, Nambiar had exhausted the three names he knew, and fer- 
vently hoped that Srinivasa Iyengar would not torture him with any 
more questions about flowers. But Srinivasa Iyengar asked one more. 



Some Stalwarts 


227 


Nambiar decided to start all over again and confidently said “daffo- 
dil.” Srinivasa Iyengar grew grave and told Nambiar that he knew 
nothing about flowers, that the colour of the daffodil he liad identified 
first was different and the shape was different. Nambiar explained “J 
am glad you have noticed the dificrcncc. Since the Great October 
Revolution, the Soviet Union has done remarkable woik in the 
hybridization of plants resulting in considerable advancement in agri- 
culture and allied subjects. This is a field in which you should talcc 
some interest while you are in the Soviet Union.” With his concocted 
theory of hybridization, about which he knew little, Nambiar managed 
to get out of an embarrassing situation. 

In Moscow the first person to receive Srinivasa Iyengar was 
Madame Kamanev representing the Society for the Promotion of 
Cultural Relations with the Soviet Union which had extended the 
invitation to him as well as to Motilal Nehru the year before. Madame 
Kamanev was the wife of a close associate of Lenin. After preliminary 
exchanges, Srinivasa Iyengar asked Madame Kamanev if freedom of 
speech prevailed in the Soviet Union, Quick came the reply “yes,” 
Srinivasa Iyengar enquired if he could stand in tlic street and tell a 
person that the government was not a good one. Again the reply was 
“yes.” Srinivasa Iyengar proceeded to ask if he could say it before two 
persons; then one by one he raised the audience to four persons. The 
answer continued to be “yes.” Then Srinivasa Iyengar asked “suppose 
1 say it before five persons?" Madame Kamanev replied “then you will 
be arrested as a street hooligan, and more stringent steps will be taken 
if the number registered a big rise.” Srinivasa Iyengar turned to 
Nambiar and whispered in Tamil his profound discovery that there 
was no freedom of speech in the Soviet Union. Madame Kamanev 
was more amused than annoyed by the questions of a frozen adoles- 
cent. 

Srinivasa Iyengar was also received in audience by Bukharin, 
President of the Third Communist International or the Comintern. 
That dignitary started the conversation with the words: “Mr Iyengar, 
I am eager to learn somctliing first-hand from you about the great 
social and national liberation movement going on in India.” Obviously 
he was giving Srinivasa Iyengar an opportunity to speak at length 
about the national movement in India. Srinivasa Iyengar’s reply was 
a counter-question; “Grass-eating Brahmin, coming to Moscow, w'hat 
else?” Bukharin commented that his question did not relate to agri- 
culture but to the progress of the revolutionary movemcntl Vv'hat 
Srinivasa Iyengar actually meant was the fact that an orthodox 
Brahmin like him had come to Moscow defying age-old injunctions

My Days with Nehru 


against crossing the seas was itself proof of the social and national 
liberation taking place in India. Nambiar, however, never felt so asha- 
med in his life. The only Indian in the last 50 years who has surpassed 
Srinivasa Iyengar in the art of answering a question by a counter-ques- 
tion is Morarji Desai who is still happily with us. 

Srinivasa Iyengar also had a meeting with Karakhan who was the 
Deputy Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union. Karakhan was a 
personal friend of Lenin and, like Bukharin, met with untimely death 
— Karakhan by execution under the orders of Stalin and Bukharin by 
mysterious assassination. During the meeting Karakhan told Srinivasa 
Iyengar “Independent India might well see to Afghanistan having the 
facility of a free port at Karachi. 

Even though Stalin was heavily preoccupied with the session oftlie 
Soviet Congress besides the conflict with Leon Trotsky, which was at 
a high pitch then, he found the time for a meeting with Srinivasa 
Iyengar. During the meeting Stalin asked if India would accept 
dominion status in case the British offered it. While Srinivasa Iyengar 
fumbled, Stalin came out with the statement: “I would suggest 
acceptance.” This came somewhat of a surprise to Srinivasa Iyengar. 

Returning to India, Srinivasa Iyengar did not find his political 
career smooth-sailing. There were many reasons for this, the most 
important of which was that there was no room for two Iyengars for 
leadership of the Congress in south India. Gandhi chose to put his 
weight behind the other Iyengar — C. Rajagopalachari even though 
Srinivasa Iyengar was far more popular. Gradually Srinivasa Iyengar 
found himself isolated in political life from which he quietly withdrew 
but not without bitterness. Some time after his withdrawal from active 
politics, Srinivasa Iyengar addressed a select gathering at the Madras 
Cosmopolitan Club. During that speech he broke into Tamil and 
said “Gandhi? Avan Sappan " — meaning “Gandhi? He is a worthless 
fellow.” 

In 1939 the people of Madras discovered that the fire in Srinivasa 
Iyengar was not completely extinguished. The sympathies of Srinivasa 
Iyengar were with Subhas Chandra Bose in his confrontation with 
Gandhi and the Old Guard in 1939. When Bose came to Madras after 
resigning from the Presidentship of the Congress and forming the For- 
ward Bloc, it was Srinivasa Iyengar who presided over the mammoth 
public meeting at the Madras beach. Thereafter Srinivasa Iyengar 
relapsed into inactivity and was not heard of until his death in 1941. 



27 Nehru^s Adherence to Truth 


Aeschylus, the father of Greek drama, coined the undying phrase “In 
•war, truth is the first casualty.” Truth is the first casualty in politics 
too. 

About politicians it can be said: 

“Munchausen was but a type of thee. 

Thou, liar of the first magnitude.” 

Baron Munchausen of Germany is acclaimed as the world’s greatest 
liar; but he was a harmless fibber. The liar in a politician is a matter 
•of serious consequence. 

It was Kipling who said of a politician: 

Pagett, M.P., was a liar, and a 
fluent liar there with. 

It was the politician in him that prompted Winston Churchill to tell 
Marshal Joseph Stalin “truth is so precious that it should be escorted 
"by a battalion of lies.” 

We have Dr Joseph Goebbels’s dictum: “the efficacy of a lie lies 
in the size of the lie and how often it is repeated.” 

The legendary Lawrence of Arabia believed that the best way to 
hide the truth was to tell half-truths. He took delight in advertising a 
fantastic story that in six years at Oxford he read every book in the 
library of the Oxford Union — the best part of 50,000 volumes. This 
means 25 volumes a day! A peculiar man with peculiar gifts, Lawrence 
was a neurotic weaving mysteries around him. Ultimately he reached 
a stage where he tended to believe his own patent lies. 

In India Asoka Mehta has the distinction of being the staunchest 
protagonist of “white lies” in public affairs. 

Gandhi %vas not a politician in the generally accepted sense of the 
word. Insofar as he was personally concerned, be cut out the seemingly 
important element in politics — the pursuit of power. What remained 
for him was the freedom of the country forming part of the wider and 
iiobler whole— the pursuit of Truth.” 



230 


My Days with Nehm 


Nehru was a man who dedicated himself for a great cause; but he 
did not believe in renouncing the world and all it contained. To him 
power was an instrument to do good, and political freedom was but 
the beginning of a prolonged struggle for economic development and 
social change. The crudities and vulgarities of politics did not infect 
Nehru. Undoubtedly Nehru was one of the most truthful politicians 
in history. This was largely due to the absence of fear in him. 

A distinguished journalist friend once asked me if I could answer 
the question “pressed to a corner, would Nehru depart from truth?”' 
I did not answer his question e.xcept to say that there was nothing 
absolute where human beings were concerned. The journalist’s ques- 
tion haunted me ever since. 

I shall relate a few instances. 

(1) Defence Minister V.K. Krishna Mcnon utilized Jiis lout from 
Madras to import a substantial number of trucks from “MAN” of 
Germany as a preliminary to the manufacture of such trucks for the 
defence forces in one of the ordnance factories in India. Krishna 
Menon wanted to circumvent Finance Minister Morarji Desai. So he 
spoke to Nehru and advanced specious arguments to convince him of 
the desirability of the project. Nehru sent for Lai Bahadur, the 
Minister for Commerce and Industry, and asked him to agree and 
facilitate the project. Lai Bahadur neither understood the implications 
nor had the courage to demur. Soon the German-made trucks arrived 
and were advertised as “Shaktiman” trucks. There were all-round 
protests. The Planning Commission wanted to knowhow much of the 
truck was “Shakti” and how much was “MAN.” The Planning 
Commission pointed out that similar trucks were produced in India, 
that no techno-eeonomic study was conducted, and that the project was 
a colossal waste. By that time, however, the agreement with “MAN”' 
had been signed. 

Faced with an awkward situation, Nehru chose not to face it squa- 
rely. Instead he sent a note to the Defence Ministry, with copies to- 
concerned ministries and the Planning Commission, deprecating the 
practice of undertaking the manufacture of items with foreign colla- 
boration when such items were already produced in the country. Thus 
Nehru saved his face and that of Lai Bahadur; and Krishna Mcnon 
got away with what he wanted by including as an item under ordnance 
factories from whose over-all financial sanctions he diverted the funds 
for the initial imports and subsequent manufacture of the trucks. 

I happened to meet Lai Bahadur soon after the controversy blew 
over. He fold me the entire story. I fold him “you bear the responsi- 
bility for the whole thing because timely opposition on your part 



Nehru's Adherence to Truth

would have scuttled the superfluous and wasteful project.” 

(2) This happened after I left government. During the height of 
Sino-Indian troubles, our Charge d'affaires in Peking attended a 
formal Chinese reception. There was understandable furore in Parlia- 
ment about this. In reply to a short notice question Nehru told Parlia- 
ment that the Charge d'affaires had asked for telegraphic instructions 
from the External Affairs Ministry and that the ministry gave him 
permission to attend. “Ministry” in popular usage is the organization 
minus the minister. Legally it comprises the minister and the secre- 
tariat. Copies of all in-coming and out-going telegrams are submitted 
to the Prime Minister by the Central Cypher Bureau. I was sure that 
the reply to such a telegram from the Charge d'affaires in Peking would 
not be sent without clearance from the Prime Minister. However, I 
made enquiries and found that the draft of the reply to the Charge 
d'affaires in Peking was approved by the Prime Minister. 

(3) A.G. Noorani, one of the reviewers of my first book, quoted 
the following from the ti'anscript of Nehru’s press conference of 7 
February 1959, the first one after my resignation from government 
and Indira’s taking over as the interim Congress President: 

Mr Mathai was not influencing me in anything, in any policy or 
important matter. . . 

I doubt if \ spoke to him at any length— may be once in ten or 
12 days. I met him daily in the course of business, papers coming 
up before me. 

This was the time when Bhupesh Gupta, Rajya Sablia’s oldest 
member, knowm for restraint, understatements, non-vociferousness, 
decorum, fairness, soft-spokeness, and fierce attachment to truth, was 
hurling vituperation at me and insinuating that I was the Deputy Prime 
Minister or even the de facto Prime Minister. No one likes to be told, 
at any rate publicly, that he is run by another. 

Insofar as I am concerned, the “theory of influence” is ridiculous. 
In fact it does not exist. One can influence the course of events; but 
one cannot influence a human being. One can place facts and opinions 
before an individual and these may have some bearing on his deci- 
sions. But the decisions are his. This was the only basis on which I 
worked with Nehru. The term “influence” exists only in the dictiona- 
rise of the weak and the infirm. I can say without hesitation that I did 
not “influence” Nehru in anything — important or unimportant. 

The second part of Nehru’s statement is totally w'rong. I felt sorry 
for him xvhen I read it in the newspapers while I was in Alraora. So 



232 


My Days with Nehru 


did many people in Delhi who were in the know. Some of them 
thought that 1 might reaet to Nehru's statement by saying somethina 
an public; and they went to Morarji Desai requesting him to get in 
touch with me so that I would keep quiet. Morarji told them" “his 
loyalty to the Prime Minister will prevent him from reacting 
publicl}'.” Morarji was right. 

I was entitled to privately ask the Prime Minister or retract publicly; 
but I was aware that it would have been inappropriate for a Prime 
Minister to eat his words publicly. However, I had ample evidence of 
Nehru’s unhappiness at the words which had slipped out. 

The instances f have enumerated are not of any particular impor- 
tance. All in all, I repeat that Nehru was one of the most truthful of 
historic men. 

On 23 September 1978 Desai said in New Delhi to a group of 40 
Americans from the Jain International Meditation Centre of New 
York something very profound “I do not go in search of office, nor do 
I run away from office.” This caused merriment to Indian readers for 
they know Morarji to be a relentless practitioner of Robert Bruce's 
dictum “if at first you don’t succeed, try try try again.” It was indeed 
at his fourth try, spread over a period of 13 years, that Morarji 
succeeded in becoming Prime Minister at the young age of 81! 
Morarji's statement to the gullible American meditators reminded me 
of what a “Swamiji” told an unsophisticated young boy, Vadivelu, of 
Madras some years ago. Vadivelu was the only son of a wealthy father 
who died when Vadivelu was a child. He was brought up by his reli- 
- gious uncle who was under the total influence of (he “Swamiji” who 
lived in a cottage specially built for him on the grounds of Vadivelu’s 
house. Vadivelu never liked the “Swamiji” because, whenever he 
wanted money, he had to get clearance from him. One week-end he 
asked his uncle for money to buy a cinema ticket and told him that the 
“Swamiji’s” door was locked. The uncle asked him to wait. Vadivelu 
waited long enough to lose his patience. He climbed to the top of the 
cottage, removed six tiles, and slipped into the middle of Swamiji’s 
room. There he found the Swamiji in bed with a young woman. In 
sonorous tones the Swamiji said “I am not here; I am in canjeevaram; 

I will return tomorrow. This is only my physical body; my astral body 
is in Canjeevaram.” Vadivelu was confounded, got out of the cottage, 
and told his uncle what he heard but not what he saw. In all serious- 
ness the uncle said “this happens to Swamiji once a week; such c.xpc- 
rience comes only to great r/shfes who arc yogis; never disturb him; 
wait till tomorrow!” When Vadivelu attained majority and came into 
his father’s property, his first act was to get rid of the Swamiji by 



Nehni’s Adherence to Truth 


233 


telling him “go to Canjeevaram and find your astral body.” 

On 23 October 1978, the Hindi daily Aaj of Varanasi pub- 
lished a report of its editor’s interview with Indira. At the interview 
Indira said “Morarji Desai tells lies when he says that none in his 
cabinet drinks liquor. She alleged that “except for one or two, all 
ministers drink.” She said “I have information that ministers approach 
foreign missions in Delhi for drinks” and added “the diplomats do not 
desire to disclose, nor do they want anybody to see the ministers drink- 
ing.” As for herself, she said “I tell a lie only when journalists put me 
inconvenient questions.” She hastened to add that she was not telling 
lies to the editor of Aaj who was interviewing her. 

Morarji, as a fanatic, is like the ostrich and the cat. He believes only 
what he wants to belive. If Indira writes to him about the drinking 
habits of the so-called dignitaries in Delhi, perhaps Morarji will not 
be averse to referring it to the Chief Justice of India to determine if 
a prima facie case exists. 

During the interview to the editor of the Aaj Indira unwittingly 
blundered into the truth about herself. 



28 Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah 


A product of the Aligarh Muslim University. Sheikh Mohammad 
Abdullah started life as a teacher and strayed into politics bv joining 
the “Muslim Conference” now a defunct organization. In 1938 he left 
the communal organization and formed the National Conference. But 
the practice of Sheikh Abdullah converting Muslim Friday prayer con- 
gregations in mosques into public meetings for political harangues 
continued and still continues. ]f such a thing is done by others 
in temples and churches, I do not know how Sheikh Abdullah would 
view it. 

Sheikh Abdullah came into contact with Nehru after the formation 
of the National Conference. He brought the National Conference 
into the mainstream of Indian political developments by making it an 
affiliate of the All India States’ Peoples Conference started by Nehru. 
He became its President in 1946 and kept the National Conference 
independent of the Indian National Congress. 

Sheikh Abdullah’s struggle was against the feudal despotism of the 
Maharaja of Kashmir. He knew that in this he would not get any 
support or assistance from M.A. Jinnah or the Muslim League. He 
considered Jinnah as no more than a jackal who was content to have 
a share in the tiger’s kill. He was powerfully influenced by Nehru's 
secular approach and unstinted support for responsible government 
and civil liberties in Indian states. 

Only communalists in India have accused Sheikh Abdullah of being 
communal. The National Conference blue-print for '‘New Kashmir'' 
laying emphasis on “land to the tiller” perturbed the small pandit 
community pampered for long by the rulers of Kashmir. They were to 
be losers of much of their land which they never cultivated. It is they 
who were vociferous in raising the bogy of communalism against the 
Sheikh. Maharaja Hari Singh never trusted Sheikh Abdullah whose 
sworn enemy he remained with incredible tenacity. But for Sheikh 
Abdullah and the unqualified support for him by Nehru, the maharaja 
would have acceded to India along with other Indian rulers. The 
maharaja could not find another popular leader who could success- 
fully challenge Sheikh Abdullah. So the role of the Maharaja in 
a crucial period remained negative and barren. Events overtook him 



Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah 


235 


and ultimately he had to abdicate. 

In the spring of 1946 the maharaja’s government arrested Sheikh 
Abdullah and other leaders of the National Conference. At the time 
of his arrest Sheikh Abdullah was on his way to Simla at Nehru’s 
request to meet him. Nehru curbed his impulse to leave the parleys 
with the British Cabinet Mission and go to Kashmir. He wanted to 
give the Viceroy, Lord Wavell, a chance to intervene. Nothing, 
happened. On 15 June 1946, Nehru notified the maharaja that he 
would arrive in the state on the 19th. The maharaja informed the 
Viceroy that he would abdicate and his Prime Minister would resign if 
the Government of India asked them not to take any action against 
Nehru. On crossing Kohala bridge into Kashmir territory on 19' 
June, Nehru and party, including Asaf Ali and Diwan Chaman Lai,, 
were arrested. Asaf Ali and Chaman Lai were to defend Sheikh 
Abdullah at his trial. I was also in the party. We were detained at 
Domel and later at Uri. The detention lasted under one week. The 
postponment of Sheikh Abdullah's trial and the insistence of the Con- 
gress Working Committee that Nehru should return, made him relent. 
We were released and we all returned. 

When the trial of Sheikh Abdullah was fixed Nehru went to 
Kashmir. This lime we were not arrested. We lived in a house boat on 
the Nagin lake. One experience during that visit stands out in 
my memory. We were invited to a dinner in the t}'pical Mogul style. 
It was a 30-course dinner, mostly of highly-spiced meat of various 
kinds which would have gladdened the heart of the revolutionary and 
gourmet Mr Suhrawardy who loved and dreamed of Indian food 
while in Europe. When I was confronted by the bewildering variety of 
rich food soaked in oil and fat, I was confused. I did not know where 
to begin. Returning to the house-boat I felt hungry and ate a few im- 
provised sandwiches and some fruits. 

It was when the raiders, aided and abetted by Pakistan, entered 
Kashmir that the maharaja took fright and signed the Instrument of 
Accession to India on 25 October 1947. As a first step the Maharaja 
released Sheikh Abdullah and his colleagues in the National Confer- 
ence from prison and left Srinagar in search of safety. 

In formally accepting the maharaja's accession to India. Governor- 
General Lord Mountbatten extracted from Nehru and the Emergency 
Committee of the Cabinet permission to add that the will of the people 
would be ascertained as soon as the law and order situation was restor- 
ed. 

The National Conference passed a resolution endorsing Kashmir’s 
accession to India. Sheikh Abdullah was appointed head of a provi- 



236 


My Days with Nehru 

siona! administration in Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after, the 
maharaja abdicated in favour of his son. 

On 3 November 1946, Nehru gave formal shape to Lord Mount- 
batten’s idea in a radio broadcast unilaterally offering a plebicite in 
Kashmir under the UN auspices. This and going to the UN with a 
•complaint of aggression against Pakistan at the end of 1947 were un- 
mitigated blunders. Neither Lord Mountbatlen nor Nehru and other 
Indian leaders had the foggiest notion of how the UN functioned and 
•of the forces at work within that organization. India’s original com- 
plaint is still unanswered. The aggressor and the aggrieved have been 
placed in the same basket and pious resolutions have been passed. 
India had been foolish enough to make concession after concession. 
This country is still eating the bitter fruits grown out of the seed 
•originally joiivt by Mountbatten. 

The offer of a plebicite in Kashmir continued as a festering sore 
affecting the internal stability in Kashmir for a long time. 

The presence of Sheikh Abdullah, the tall figure made taller by his 
tall fez cap, with his flamboyant gown, in New York at the UN early 
in 1948 along with N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar, made people think 
that he was no more than a dandy. And the Pakistanis, ably assisted 
by the British, succeeded in making the uncharitable expressions like 
“stooge” and “Indian Quisling” stick to him. His frequent impromptu 
utterances to the press on the Kashmir and other questions caused 
only needless embarrassments. In fact the Sheikh’s presence, contrary 
to expectations, was more a liability than an asset. 

For two years after acceptance of office in 1948 Sheikh Abdullah 
was busy organizing popular resistance to aggression by raiders and 
infiltration by Pakistanis as well as the work of the Kashmir Constitu- 
ent Assembly. When normalcy was established, Sheikh Abdullah began 
to exhibit his flamboyance and play the lion and the messiah. Acqui- 
sition of air-conditioned Cadillac cars was part of the flamboyance. 
His principal colleagues, more especially Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, 
G.M. Sadiq and D.P. Dhar started to have misgivings about the 
Sheikh. Dwarak Nath Kachru was also in that group. Kachru was a 
young Kashmiri whom Nehru encouraged before independence and 
made him General-Secretary of the All India States Peoples’ Confer- 
ence. After independence Nehru appointed him as one of his Private 
secretaries in the government. It was one of Kachru’s functions to keep 
in touch with Kashmir developments and to keep Nehru informed. 
From the first half of 1949 Kachru had been telling Nehru about the 
Sheikh's unreliability. Kachru even went to the extent of making a trip 
to Dehra Dun, without Nehru’s knowledge, to acquaint Sardar Patel 



Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah

of developments in Kashmir and the need to discipline if not replace 
Sheikh Abdullah. Kachru continued his contacts with Sardar Patel. 
Another person who privately joined the Bakshi group as an interloper, 
ready with advice to any who was willing to listen, was Colonel B.M. 
Kaul who later rose to be a Lieutenant General. Kaul was a military- 
man with political ambitions and capable of the worst tj'pe of intrigue 
associated with the normal run of Kashmiri Brahmins. 

Early in life Sheikh Abdullah acquired a .reputation of being a 
lady-killer. He maintained his reputation. Like all vain men, Sheikh 
Abdullah developed the illusion that he was irresistible to all women 
and that they were but sitting ducks for him. And he certainly was as 
vain as a peacock. 

Nehru did all he could to accommodate the Sheikh to accord, 
special status to Kashmir in the Constitution of India even thougL 
there was considerable opposition to it. This only whetted his appetite. 
Other ideas entered his head. 

Sheikh Abdullah wanted an independent Kashmir having good rela- 
tions with both India and Pakistan. He had secret talks with some 
foreign powers, particularly the United States, about the future 
of Kashmir even though he denied it when asked repeatedly from 
1950 onwards. 1 quote below the contents of a secret telegram sent by 
the American Ambassador Loy Henderson to the State Department 
on 29 September 1950, which was made public in Washington in July 
1978: 


While in Kashmir I had two secret discussions with Sheikh. 
Abdullah, Prime Minister, at his request, during the course of which' 
he discussed with apparent frankness some of the problems and 
views on the future of Kashmir. He denied with considerable 
emphasis stories to the effect he was pro-communist, pro-Soviet,, 
anti-west, or anti-US. 

He admitted there were two communists in his cabinet. He said 
during elections which have just been held they had both been 
defeated and he had been compelled to arrange other constituen- 
cies for them. He could not afford to have a split with communists 
and fellow-travellers at the present juncture since they would turn 
on the National Conference in the same way that Chinese 
communists turned against Knomintang. He had to get along with 
them as best as he could so long as the future of Kashmir was 
undetermined. 

He was also compelled to take certain measures such as break- 
ing up of large estates without compensation to land-owners.

nationalization of certain enterprises etc in order that (he National 
Conference rather than the communists should get credit wiih the 
people. Therefore so long as there was a possibility that there would 
at some time be a popular vote as to the future of Kashmir, the 
National Conference must do as much for peasants and workers as 
communists could reasonably promise to do. 

He is not unaware of the dangers of communism but he was 
convinced his present course was the best method of meeting this 
danger. He personally had no hope for the economic future 
of Kashmir regardless whether it went to India or Pakistan or 
became independent unless it would have friendly interest and 
economic cooperation of the XJS. 

In discussing the future of Kashmir, Abdullah was vigorous in 
restating that in his opinion it should be independent; that an over- 
whelming majority of the population desired this independence; and 
that he had reason to believe that some Azad Kashmir leaders 
desired independence and would be willing to co-operate with 
leaders of the National Conference if there was reasonable chance 
that such co-operation would result in independence. The Kashmir 
people could not understand why the UN consistently ignored in- 
dependence as one of the possible solutions for Kashmir. It had 
held a special Assembly to deal with independence for Palestine 
which was smaller in area and population and less economically 
viable than Kashmir. 

Kashmir people had a language and cultural background of 
their own. Their Hindus, by custom and tradition, widely differed 
from Hindus in India and in outlook and background. Their 
Moslems were also quite different from Moslems of Pakistan. The 
fact was that the population of Kashmir was homogenous in spite 
of the presence of a Hindu minority. 

When I asked Abdullah if he thought that Kashmir could 
remain a stable independent country without the friendly support of 
India and Pakistan, he replied in the negative. In his opinion an 
independent Kashmir could exist only in case it had the friendship 
of both India and Pakistan, in case both these countries had 
friendly relations with each other; and in case the USA through the 
UN or directly would enable it, by investments or other economic 
assistance, to develop its magnificent resources. Adherence of 
Kashmir to India would not lead in the forseeable future to improv- 
ing the miserable economic lot of the population. There were 
so many areas in India in urgent need of economic development. He 
was convinced that Kashmir would get relatively little attention. 


Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah

Never-the-less, it would be preferable for Kashmir to go to India 
than to Pakistan. It would be disastrous for Kashmiris to be 
brought under the control of a Government with a medieval 
Koranic outlook. 

If it became necessary to compromise, the Sheikh would have been 
content to leave Jammu and Ladakh to India and Azad Kashmir to 
Pakistan as the price for India and Pakistan guaranteeing the indepen- 
dence of the valley. He had grandoise ideas of an alliance with the 
United States which would bring in massive American investment 
which could transform the valley into a Switzerland of Asia. 

All available information indicated that Sheikh Abdullah was try- 
ing to go his own w'ay. Reports from the Intelligence Bureau, impres- 
sions of journalists and visitors to Kashmir tallied with what some of 
Sheikh Abdullah’s own colleagues have been saying. 

Kingsley Martin, editor of the New Statesman and Nation, a shrewd 
observer and political commentator, after a visit to Kashmir early in 
the fifties, said in private that he was convinced that Sheikh Abdullah 
was not interested in Jammu and Ladakh, that his ultimate aim was 
the creation of the valley as an independent Sheikhdom enjoying 
hereditary succession with close tics with the United States. 

In an interview to Khushwant Singh, published in the Illustrated 
Weekly of India dated 21 April 1974, Sheikh Abdullah said of the pre- 
1953 period “when I protested against the rejection of all Muslim 
candidates for jobs in the Post and Telegraph Department, instead of 
questioning their own pretensions of secularism, Indians began to 
question ray secularism and cast aspersions on my loyalty to India.” 
When Khushwant Singh said “surely not Pandit Nehru,” the Sheikh 
conceded “no not Nehru” and added a back-hander “Nehru remained 
in the clouds. First it was Sardar Patel. He never wanted Kashmir to 
be part of India. He did not like my being close to Nehru. When he 
failed to create differences between us, he had surrounded Nehru with 
his own cronies who kept poisoning his mind against me — men like 
Mehrchand Mahajan, M.O. Mathai, Jai Narain Vyas, and Ajit 
Prasad Jain.” When I read this, I wondered if Sheikh Abdullah had 
gone insane. Mehr Chand Mahajan, who became the Chief Justice of 
India, never surrounded Nehru. In fact Nehru kept him at a distance. 
Ajit Prasad Jain was not a crony of Sardai Patel but a lieutenant of 
Rafi Ahmed Kidv/ai and did not surrounded Nehru. Poor Jai Narain 
Vyas also did not surround Nehru. Neither was he a crony of Sardar 
Patel. In fact he had a soft corner for Sheikh Abdullah. Only I 
surrounded Nehru, and nobody ever accused me of being a crony of 



240 


My Days with Nehru 


Sardar Patel. There was no need for me to poison Nehru's mind as 
there were so many at it. The entire Nehru family, with the exception 
of Indira who kept herself aloof, not excluding Feroze Gandhi and 
Padmaja Naidu, wholly distrusted Sheikh Abdullah and had dinned 
into Nehru’s ears that Sheikh Abdullah was unreliable and would let 
him down badly one day. Feroze Gandhi, in particular, was a deadly 
enemy of Sheikh Abdullah. This enmity had its origin in something 
personal during the brief period of his honeymoon spent in Kashmir 
in the summer of 1942. When Feroze Gandhi heard of the arrest of 
Sheikh Abdullah in 1953 he came to my study beaming. He said that 
Bakshi did a foolish thing in arresting Sheikh Abdullah, and added 
that Bakshi should have had Sheikh Abdullah taken to the top of a 
lonely hill on the Azad Kashmir border, pushed down and shot, and 
published the news that Abdullah had fled to Pakistan. 

All the actions of Sheikh Abdullah during several months preced- 
ing his ouster in 1953 fitted into his grand design. Atlcast from 1950 
onwards all the colleagues of Sheikh Abdullah, with the exception of 
Mirza Afzal Beg, were at logger-heads with him for two main reasons: 

(1) Sheikh Abdullah’s extreme reluctance to frankly discuss matters 
and his tendency to expect his colleagues to fall in line with his whims; 

(2) his refusal to initiate certain obvious steps, including the extension 
of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of India to the state, arising 
from the broad decision accepting the accession of the State to India. 
Sheikh Abdullah was interested in all the rights but not in any of the 
obligations. He snubbed Rafi Ahmed Kidwai and publicly insulted 
Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on Id Day at the Idgah congregation in 
Srinagar. These were the two men who genuinely wanted to correct 
him in a friendly way and to help and support him. But by that time 
Sheikh Abdullah had become such an unbalanced person that he was 
in no mood to be corrected or helped. His government was disintegrat- 
ing and his only supporter in the Council of Ministers was Mirza 
Afzal Beg. He became rude and arrogant and went to the extent of tell- 
ing Ajit Prasad Jain that he found no difference between Nehru and 
Syma Prasad Mookerji, and also threatened that he would set fire to 
the state. Sheikh Abdullah and Afzal Beg finally unleashed mass 
hysteria in the valley by openly challenging the accession, question- 
ing the presence of Indian forces in the state, and demanding the right 
of self-determination through a plebicite to be held under the super- 
vision of an international authority. Maulana Azad and Rafi Ahmed 
Kidwai were perturbed. Nehru invited Sheikh Abdullah to come to 
Delhi to talk over matters. Sheikh Abdullah refused. Maulana Azad, 
Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, Gopalaswami Ayyangar and Nehru came to the 



Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah 


241 


painful conclusion that the time had come to choose between two 
evils. 

One day in 1953 Nehru called me and said he wanted something 
brief to be typed, but did not wish to give it to any PA. I noted down 
the points and some of the phrases he wanted to use. Then I locked 
myself in my bed-foom and typed out on a plain sheet of paper 
a “Memorandum of Instructions.” It was not addressed to anyone; it 
was not signed by anyone. It contained the date, not even the place. 
Ajit Prasad Jain, a Minister and close confidant of Rafi Ahmed 
Kidwai, took the sealed “Memorandum of Instructions” by air to 
Srinagar to be delivered to Yuvaraj Karan Singh, the Sadar Riyasat 
(Governor) of Kashmir. Karan Smgh was to dismiss Sheikh 
Mohammad Abdullah from the office of Prime Minister of Jammu 
and Kashmir, and to appoint Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad as his 
successor. No further action was to be taken against Sheikh Abdullah 
imless he indulged in violent activities or instigated violence. 

Later, when I conveyed the news that Sheikh Abdullah was arrest- 
ed, Nehru was annoyed. Recourse to arrest was to be taken only if 
Sheikh Abdullah put himself in the wrong. He rang up Karan Singh 
and expressed his disapproval of the action taken. He could do 
nothing more. What actually happened was that Bakshi took pre- 
emptive action. Bakshi had absolutely no doubt that Sheikh Abdullah 
would break the law and create disturbances. He took the bull by the 
horns. The central intervention in Kashmir met with widespread 
approval by the press and public in India. Nehru pocketed the compli- 
ment though he was apprehensive of international reactions. 

One of the reviewers of my first book asked why I did not say any- 
thing about the report that Nehru wept when he heard the news of 
Sheikh Abdullah’s arrest in 1953. The reason is that I had never heard 
such a story. The report is totally incorrect. It must have emenated 
from some interested people. 

The Intelligence Bureau succeeded in leading Bakshi Ghulam 
Mohammad up the garden path by fabricating conspiracy changes 
against Sheikh Abdullah accusing him of collusion with Pakistan. 
Ultimately the conspiracy case had to be withdrawn. 

Sheikh Abdullah was released from prison in 1964 during the Chief 
Ministership of G.M. Sadiq before Nehru’s death. 

Sheikh Abdullah’s long incarceration made him bitter and suspici- 
ous. It was but a natural human reaction. However, it was unwise, in 
the extreme, for him to shov.' his nationality as “Kashmiri” in his 
application for an Indian passport. It is just like a man from the 
Nilgiri Hills saying that his nationality is “Toda.” A similar foolish 



242 


My -Days with Nelmi 


act on the part of M. Karunanidhi is on record before he came 
to power in Tamil Nadu. Jn the register of a luxury .hotel in Madras, 
where he stayed for some days for writing a film script, he wrote down 
his nationality as “Dravidian.” . 

Soon after his release in 1964 Sheikh Abdullah was at his old pet 
game again— the ultimate creation of independent Kashmir. He 
embarked'upon an attempt to bring India and Pakistan together for a 
lasting settlement of the Kashmir question. He persuaded Nehru, by 
then an ill man, to let him go to Islamabad for talks with President 
Ayub Khan. When the news of this got published, public reaction was 
unfavourable. In this connection two pieces of disqueting news reach- 
ed me; 

(1) A Brigadier of Army Headquarters said at a party that the army 
felt very strongly about recent political developments in Kashmir 
and added that there would be trouble if any weakening was shown 
by the Prime Minister in regard to Kashmir’s accession to India 
because the army did not want to have the shamefull feeling that its 
soldiers shed their blood in vain. The Prime Minister let down the 
army once by ordering a cease-fire when our army was poised for 
clearing the raiders and Pakistanis from the entire Jammu and 
JCashmir area. It was the Prime Minister who created Azad Kashmir 
and not Pakistan. The army had enough humiliations after Independ- 
ence; and it was not going to stomach the pusillanimity of politicians 
any more. 

(2) A major in the array said openly at the Delhi railway station 
that if the Prime Minister did any monkey tricks in regard to Kashmir, 
he would have to go the same way as Gandhi. 

On 28 April 1964 I communicated these to the Prime Minister for 
two main reasons: 

(а) The Prime Minister was never used to calling for an appraisal 
of the reactions of the armed forces on any vital issue. 

(б) At my last meeting with him the previous day I came to the 
painful conclusion that Nehru was not in a mental state to take in 
even elementary things and that it would be dangerous for India to 
let him take any initiative in any important matter. 

What I conveyed to the Prime Minister had the desired effect. He 
took steps to make it known publicly that the proposed visit of Sheikh 
Abdullah to Pakistan did not mean any change in India’s basic posi- 
tion relating to Kashmir. 

Nehru died while Sheikh Abdullah was having his parleys in 
Pakistan. He returned with the feeling that his plans had gone awry. 

Sheikh Abdullah had to live in frustration for another decade. He 



Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah 


243 


bitterly disapproved of India’s intervention in East Pakistan which 
resulted in the dismemberment of Pakistan and the creation of the 
independent state of Bangladesh. 

The reduced position of Pakistan in the sub-continent and in the 
world made Sheikh Abdullah realise that it was no longer possible to 
play India and Pakistan against each other for the fulfilment of his 
dreams. This realism induced him to come to terms with realities of 
the situation. India responded, and Sheikh Abdullah agreed to head 
the government in Jammu and Kashmir in 1975. His national Confer- 
ence won significantly in the elections which followed. 

Some of the recent actions of Sheikh Abdullah remind one of the 
proverbial cat which is suspicious of cold water, having once fallen 
into hot water. Sheikh Abdullah sees the ghost of “1953” lurking in 
every corner. That partly explains his unbecoming action in compel- 
ling members of his council of ministers and his party legislators to 
take a pledge of personal allegiance to him. It also partly explains his 
break with Mirza Afzal Beg, a close colleague of 45 years standing 
and who stood by him in bis difficult days. These are unhealthy symp- 
toms of personality cult and dynastic tendencies. Or has the Sheikh 
become shaky? Fear is a bad companion for the “Lion of Kashmir.” 
Really he has nothing to fear but fear itself. 



29 Some Ministers 


Even with an unassailable position in a party with overwhelming 
majority in Parliament, ministry-making in a vast country with much 
diversity was not an easy matter for Nehru. All kinds of interests like 
religious minorities, women, scheduled castes and tribes, regional, 
linguistic, experienced, old, young with promise etc had to be taken 
into consideration. Efforts to accommodate all the competing interests 
often ended up in the efficiency of the cabinet and council of ministers 
becoming a casualty. To some extent this imbalance was redressed by 
bringing in some competent men into the cabinet from outside and 
subsequently getting them elected to the Rajya Sabha. 

Barring a few exceptions, more especially after Sardar Patel's death, 
Nehru’s colleagues were not men who would frankly speak out in his 
presence. Many were tongue-tied before him, some were ever anxious 
not to displease him, and some tried to find out in advance what was 
likely to please him. Nearly all had an awe of him. The net result, 
was that Nehru was not well served by his colleagues. This has also 
happened to other great leaders who towered over their colleagues in 
Parliamentary democracies. A stri)dng recent example was Winston 
Churchill. 

In my first book I have written about several prominent colleagues 
of Nehru in the government. In this chapter I shall write briefly 
about some ministers. 

C.D. Deshmukh 

He was an outstanding ICS officer who ended up as the Deputy 
Governor and later Governor of the Resen'e Bank of India during 
British times. Nehru wanted to include Deshmukh in the interim 
government in September 1946. Deshmukh had just then retired from 
the Reserve Bank of India. He told Nehru about his family troubles 
and that he wanted to make a final effort at reconciliation with his 
English wife. After conveying his excuses to Nehru, he went to England 
where his wife was staying in estrangement. Deshmukh’s mission end- 
ed in failure. He even suffered the humiliation of being called “blackie” 



Some Ministers 


245 


by his daugther. Deshmukh ultimately returned to India after the final 
break with his wife. 

Dushmukh was appointed a member of the Planning Commission 
when it was constituted. When JohnMatthai resigned from the Govern- 
ment oh the 25 May 1950, Deshmukh was appointed as the Finance 
Minister. He continued to be a member of the Planning Commission 
as long as he was in the Government. 

Though his background was that of a civil servant, as Finance 
Minister, Deshmukh showed considerable flexibility. He was a welcome 
change from John Matthai rigidity. 

For the 1951/52 general election to the Lok Sabha Deshmukh had 
told me that he had decided not to accept my financial contribution 
from any one because he happened to be the Finance Minister. He set 
apart a sum much below the limit prescribed in the election law and 
restricted his expenditure accordingly. He won the election comfort- 
ably. He was happy that the Prime Minister adjusted his Maharashtra 
' election tour programme in such a way as to visit his constituency. 

Some time after Deshmukh became Finance Minister there were 
unprecedented floods in Bihar. The Prime Minister visited the state. 
He was moved by the sight of the damage, death and destruction caused 
by the fury of Kosi, Bihar’s river of sorrow. He announced that the Kosi 
dam would be included in the plan. Deshmukh was incensed by toe 
Prime Minister's action in making a public announcement committing 
the government without consulting the Finance Minister and the Plan- 
ning Commission. He wrote to the Prime Minister in rather intemperate 
language objecting to what he did. It was a legitimate reaction on the 
part of the Finance Minister. But it was not legitimate on the part of 
the Finance Minister to tell some prominent Bombay industrialists that 
he would see to it that the Prime "Minister ate his words. In fact the 
occasion for that did not arise as the Kosi project was ultimately sanc- 
tioned by the government. 

Soon after Deshmukh became Finance Minister, I discussed with 
two persons of wide experience in administration the question of decen- 
tralization of financial powers. ThepersonswereNarahari Rao, Compt- 
roller and Auditor-General of India, who was a former Finance Secret- 
ary, and Asok K. Chanda, Secretary in the Ministry of Production, 
who was a former Financial Commissioner in the Railway Board and 
Financial Adviser in the Defence Ministry. The idea was that within the 
limitations of the budget the departmental ministers, aided and advised 
by the finance officers, should be the final authority for financial sanc- 
tions and not the Finance Ministers. This would eliminate needless de- 
lays. Several ministers had previously complained to the Prime Minis- 



246 


My Days with Nehru 


ter about the functioning of the Finance Ministry as an octopus reduc- 
ing departmental ministers to non-entities and causing inordinate dela}'s. 
At my suggestion both Narahari Rao and Asok Chanda sent notes on 
the subject and how to process the matter. The Prime Minister took it 
up with Deshmukh and told him that he would like the matter to be 
discussed at a series of informal meetings at which he himself, the Fin- 
ance Minister (Deshmukh), the Education Minister (Maulana Azad), 
the Home Minister and the Comptroller and Auditor-General should 
be present. The Prime Minister also proposed that the Cabinet Secret- 
ary and the Secretary in the Ministry of Production (Asok K. Chanda), 
who had already been chosen to be the next Comptroller and Auditor- 
General, should be in attendance. Copies of the notes of Narahari Rao 
and Asok Chanda were also circulated to all concerned. 

In his reaction Deshmukh was subjective. He viewed the proposal as 
a move to curb his empire. His ire fell on Asok Chanda. Deshmukh 
wrote to the Prime Minister objecting to the proposal. He also wrote 
that he regretted having agreed to the appointment of Asok K. Chanda 
ns the Comptroller and Auditor-General and asked for its cancellation. 
There was a threat that, if the appointment was not cancelled, he would 
be compelled to resign from the government. I advised the PM to ignore 
the threat and told him that Deshmukh would not resign. In the mean 
time I seized the opportunity of turning the table on Deshmukh. 1 re- 
quested his friend N.R. Pillai to advise Deshmukh not to send any for- - 
mal letter of resignation because of the possibility of the Prme Minister 
accepting it. Deshmukh did not send his resignation and chose to “eat 
his words.” 

The meetings suggested by the Prime Minister took place and the 
subject to decentralization of financial powers was discussed. As a res- 
ult some changes took place. The changes were completed during the 
first tenure of Morarji Deasi as Finance Minister. 

The failure of his marriage to an English woman and the mental 
•uflferings accruing from it drove Deshmukh to go to the other extreme. 
He decided to marry Durgabai, a middle-aged Congress woman from 
Andhra Pradesh, who was a childless widow. Most people were 
surprised when the marriage took place. Durgabai is a thoroughly un- 
sophisticated person. She was a member of the Planning Commission 
at the time of marriage. Earlier she was a member of Parliament, but 
was defeated in the first general election. 

The first person Deshmukh told about his decision to marry was 
N.R. Pillai. The second was myself. After that he sent for P.K, 
Panikkar who was a Sanskrit scholar and an amateur astrologer. 
Deshmukh gave Panikkar his own horoscope and that of Durgabai 



Some Ministers 


247 


•without disclosing that he had actually decided to marrj'. After exam- 
ining the horoscopes, Panikkar told Deshmukh that it would be an ill- 
matched marriage which would end in his political eclipse. Panikkar 
strongly advised against the marriage. Deshmukh told him that it was 
too late to break off. Later. Panikkar got the information that a profes- 
sional astrologer recommended the marrige saying that it would give 
Deshmukh political strength. Panikkar’s information was that Durgabai 
had brought in the professional astrologer. 

Before Deshmukh broke the news to the Prime Minister, I remind- 
ed him that it was on his recommendation contained in a personal 
hand-written note that the Prime Minister appointed Durgabai as a 
member of the Planning Commission, and that he would do well to 
clear this matter with the Prime Minister. At the meeting with the 
Prime Minister, Deshmukh told him that when he made the recom- 
mendation about Durgabai’s inclusion in the Planning Commission, he 
had no intention of marrying her. When the marriage took place in 
Durgabai’s house on Akbar Road I was present with the Prime 
Minister and a few others at the civil registration ceremony. 

Soon after the marriage, Durgabai was relieved of the membership 
of the Planning Commission and was appointed Chairman of the 
newly-created Central Social Welfare Board. 

Rumours about fahtastic astrological predictions and Deshmukh 
spread like wild fire after his marriage and even reached the Prime 
Minister. They were assiduously spread by females in Parliament who 
grew jealous of Durgabai. They spread the news that both Deshmukh 
and Durgabai were terribly under the influence of astrology. 

During the Prime Minister’s visit to Norway, the offer to start a 
fishery project in India was made by the Norwegian government. In 
fact the.Norwegian Minister for Fisheries spoke to me about it before 
the formal offer was made. He asked me where I would recommend 
that it should be located. I replied ‘-Kerala because your project is 
for sea-fishing and Kerala has a long coast-line.” He made a note of 
this. 

Later, in India, when the matter was processed, Deshmukh, as 
Finance Minister and Member of the Planning Commission, expres- 
sed his preference for Palvel in Maharashtra for the location of the 
Norwegian fishery project. Palvel happened to be in Deshmukh’s 
Parliamentary' constituency. Information about this reached me before 
■ a formal decision was taken. I told the Prime Minister about it, and 
his intervention settled the matter. That is how the Norwegian Fish- 
ery Project came to be located at Neendakara in Kerala. 

Deshmukh was not destined to be in government for long. As a 



2^8 


My Days with Nehru 


Maharashtrian he was exercised over the non-inclusion of Bombay in 
the Maharashtra state when government’s decisions were made on 
the recommendations of the. Slates Reorganisation Commission. He 
resigned on 24 July 1956. Nehru held charge of the Finance Ministry 
temporarily until T.T. Krishnaraachari was appointed Finance Minister 
on the 1 September 1956. 

Maulana Azad continued to have a soft corner for Dcshmukh. On 
the Maulana’s recommendation, Deshmukh was appointed Chairman 
of the University Grants Commission. Later he became the Vice 
Chancellor of the Delhi University. After completing his term as Vice 
Chancellor, Deshmukh retired from public life. , 

Dr John Matthai 

In my first book I have written something about John Matthai. He 
studied economics in England and became a professor at the Madras 
University. He was picked up by the British and appointed as a 
member of the Tariff' Commission of which he became Chairman 
subsequently— a position which had the status of an Additional Secre- 
tary to the Government of India. As Chairman of the Tariff Com- 
mission John Matthai is reported to have shown some favours to the 
Tatas on steel. This annoyed the British who sent him out as the 
Director-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics in 
Calcutta — a post which did not enjoy more than the status of a Joint 
Secretary to the Government of India. Eventually John Matthai 
resigned and joined the Tata Group of industries as a Director. He 
came into contact with Nehru in his capacity as Chairman of the 
National Planning Committee appointed by the Indian National 
Congress. 

While in Bombay as a Director of the Tatas, John Matthai was 
actively connected with the formulation of the “Bombay Plan” — a 
project sponsored by prominent Indian Industrialists. 

In my first book I have dealt with John Matthai’s entry into the 
interim government in September 1946 as finance member, his transfer 
to railways when the Muslim League joined the interim government, 
and appointment as Finance Minister in the dominion government on 
the exit of R.K. Shanmukham Chetty. 

Many people considered that by 1946 John Matthai was out-of-date 
in economics. They doubted if in economic theory he had advanced 
from what is contained in the “Wealth of Nations” by Adam Smith. 
They were not sure if he was influenced by John Maynard Keynes 
whose books “Treatise on Money” and “The General Theory of 



Some Ministers 


249 


Employment, Interest and Money” profoundly influenced the 
economic thought and government policy all over the world. 

As a man set in his views, he disliked taking advice from economic 
advisers within the Government of India. Dr P.J. Thomas, Economic 
Adviser in the Finance Ministry, became his earliest antipathy. 
Thomas was John Matthai’s successor at the Madras University and 
had a good standing as an economist. John Matthai could not stand 
the sight of Dr Gyan Chand, an economist whom Nehru thought well 
of before he entered the government. One can’t blame John Matthai 
for his attitude towards Gyan Chand because the latter was a woolly- 
headed person. 

As Finance Minister John Matthai was not much more than a 
calculating machine. He lacked social consciousness, compassion and 
vision so essential in a Finance Minister of an underdeveloped country 
which had to catch up with time after accepting universal adult 
suffrage. And he had absolutely no political background or under- 
standing. He was, however, a man of personal financial integrity. It 
is recognised that a liberal person will tend to become conservative 
after working in financial administration, and a conservative person 
tends to become rigid. John Matthai belonged to the latter category. 

During the first year of John Matthai’s Finance Ministership a silly 
thing happened in which I got involved. The Budget Officer in the 
Finance Ministry sent the budget papers under double cover marked 
TOP Secret and heavily sealed to A.V. Pai, Principal Private Secre- 
tary to the Prime Minister. He opened it and got a fright when he 
discovered that it was the budget He hastened to my room with the 
file and put it on my table as if he was getting rid of a time-bomb. 
That good and honest man said “we are all compromised; please give 
it to the Prime Minister personally.” 1 said “I have not seen it; why 
compromise me?; Why don’t you give it to the Prime Minister your- 
self?.” Before I finished the sentence he had hurried out of the room 
as if the time-bomb was about to explode. 

It was the usual practice for the Prime Minister and the President 
to see the budget in advance and to initial it. I did not wish to have 
a second experience like this. I rang up the Budget Officer and asked 
him to come over. When he came, I told him that a new procedure 
had to be adopted in getting the initials of the Prime Minister and the 
President on the budget. I said the Budget Officer should fix an 
appointment with the Prime Minister and come personally with the 
budget, hand it over to him, get his initials and take it back. The 
President should also be dealt with in the same manner. This would 
ensure secrecy and avoid embarrassment to others. I also said that on 



250 


My Days with Nehru 


these errands he should be accompanied by at least one security guard. 
Then I told him “I have not looked at, the papers which were placed 
on my table by A.V. Pai, Now you take up the papers and come with 
me to the Prime Minister’s room.” There the formalities were com- 
pleted on the spot. This practice continues to this day. 

In my previous book I have narrated an incident involving one of 
his sons which coloured John Matthai’s attitude towards Nehru— an 
attitude which ultimately bordered on hostility. This came to the fore 
when Nehru constituted the Planning Commission. The man who was 
intimately connected with the “Bombay Plan” suddenly opposed 
planning. He was subjective in his reaction. He thought that the 
importance of his position as Finance Minister would be minimized, 
as if he was going to be Finance Minister for life! He pictured the 
Planning Commission, with the Prime Minister as its Chairman, as a 
super-cabinet. He publicly stated that the Planning Commission 
would be a fifth wheel in the coach, and resigned. Nehru had no 
hesitation in accepting the resignation. This happened on the 25 May 
1950, on the eve of Nehru’s departure for Indonesia on a good-will 
visit. An unseemly exchange of public statements followed between 
John Matthai sitting in Delhi on solid ground and Nehru sitting in 
the naval cruiser INS Delhi floating on the high seas. John Matthai 
was succeeded by C.D. Deshmukh as Finance Minister. 

John Matthai lost no time in rejoining the Tatas as a Director. He 
wrote a short series of articles in the Times of India in which he paid 
tribute to Nehru as the most inspiring man he had worked with. 

In the 1951/52 general elections John Matthai filed his nomination 
to fight the election to Lok Sabha from the Kottayam parliamentary 
constituency as an Independent against the Congress. A local Con- 
gressmen filed an objection under the relevant provision of the elec- 
tion laws saying that John Matthai was a Director of a company 
having contacts with the Government of India. The Returning Ofllcer 
upheld the objection and rejected John Matthai’s nomination papers. 
Thus ended his attempt to enter Parliament on his own. 

N.F. Gadgil 

A typical Maharashtrian Brahmin and an old Congressman, 
Gadgil was a protege of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It was on the 
latter’s recommendation that Nehru took Gadgil into the cabinet on 
15 August 1947, and gave him the portfolio of Works, Mines and 
Power. At that time “Power” included "Irrigation” also. 

Gadgil had all the cunning of the Peshwas but not their efficiency. 


Some Ministers 


251 


He was, however, quick in his decisions some of which w'ere not tem- 
pered by wisdom. 

As an ardent supporter of Vallabhbhai Patel, he considered that deni- 
gration of Nehru was part of his mission. For this purpose he gathered 
round him some carefully selected journalists to whom he disclosed 
trends in cabinet discussions. It never occurred to Gadgil that he 
owed some loyalty to the Prime Minister. Many of the leakages of 
cabinet secrets were traced to Gadgil by the Intelligence Bureau. 

Gadgil was an obscurantist in caste and class consciousness. He 
took great delight in building separate residential colonies in Delhi 
for government servants of various, grades and naming them “appro- 
priately.” The colony for peons and chaprasis was christened '■"Seva 
Nagar,” the one for clerks was christened “Vinaya Nagar” the one 
for junior officer grade was christened ""Man Nagar” and the one for 
higher grade officers was christened ""Shan Nagar.” 

The quarters for the lowest-paid government employees were 
located as far away from the Secretariat as possible involving long 
peddling on bicycles. For those who can afford to maintain cars, 
residences were as near the Secretariat as possible. Once. I suggested 
to him to build a residential colony for ministers and senior-rnost 
officials with cars on the outskirts of Delhi and see that their cooks 
were, given quarters only in ‘"Seva Nagar,” PAS in ‘'Vinaya Nagar” 
' and Private Secretaries in “Man Nagar” — all several miles apart. I also 
suggested that the exclusive colony be christened “Maha Mahodaya 
Nagar .” ' 

While he was minister, Gadgil’s wife died. In keeping with the 
Indian practice of torturing those in bereavement by instant visita- 
tions instead of leaving them alone for a while, people rushed with 
long faces to offer their condolences to HM (Honourable Minister). 
Gadgil, with his capacity for quick decisions, confounded every one 
by marrying again within a month. This made the following Sanskrit 
lines come powerfully to my mind: 

Mathru Dukham Nirantharam, 

Bharthni Dukham Punar Bhariya. 

Though with no RSS sympathies, Gadgil was not free from com- 
munalism. After partition this communalism developed into fierce 
hostility towards Pakistan. He was totally opposed to the attitude of 
Gandhi and Nehru. Left to himself he would have welcomed the 
migration of all Muslims from India to Pakistan. He had no use for 
Maulana Azad and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai. 



252 


My Days with Nehru 


Before the Indus Water Treaty was signed by India and Pakistan, 
the sharing of waters flowing from India thcpugh Pakistan was beset 
by constant disputes. While the subject of irrigation and power was 
with GadgiJ, he took delight in playing monkey tricks. He was a man 
who had no capacity to see beyond his nose. He was woefully lacking 
in statesmanship. On one occasion he exceeded all limits by drastically 
reducing supply of water to Pakistan. When there were protests, there 
were immediate denials. Finally Pakistan flew foreign observers and 
foreign journalists over vast areas of parched earth in west Punjab. 
Tell-tale photographs were published in newspapers in Pakistan and 
abroad. India was put in an akward position. Nehru was deeply upset. 
He summoned a meeting of representatives of the Punjab government 
and senior civil, engineering and technical officers of Gadgil’s 
ministry. Gadgil himself was present. Nehru asked for explanations. 
No valid explanation was forthcoming. Gadgil made a feeble attempt 
to defend the indefensible. Nehru shouted at him and asked him to 
resign. This was the only time that Nehru asked a cabinet colleague- 
to resign in the presence of officials and other subordinates. Nehru 
did not follow up and press for the resignation. However, “Irrigation 
and Power” was taken away from Gadgil to constitute a separate 
ministry. 

After the 1956/57 general elections Nehru refused to take Gadgil 
into the government. Subsequently Gadgil was sent as a governor 
which he gave up in disgust after a brief experience. 

Sri Prakasa {1890-1971) 

Son of the renowned Sanskrit scholar and philosopher of Banaras, 
Dr Bhagwan Das, Sri Prakasa was a personal friend and contempo- 
rary of Nehru at Cambridge. The friendship between the two was 
abiding and life-long, cemented by common endeavour and suffering 
in the cause of India’s freedom. They called each other by first names. 
Nehru called him “Prakasa” and the latter called Nehru “Jawahar- 
lal.” 

There was something child-like about Sri Prakasa. He was a guile- 
less person. He would open his heart to Nehru even- in regard to the 
troubles with his children. He was such a sensitive soul that he had a 
sad and tortured look. 

In the early years of independence Sri, Prakasa was a man on 
whose reliability and loyalty Nehru could depend and to whom he 
turned when he needed such a person. Nehru chose him as the first 
Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan in 1947. He served in Karachi 



Some Ministers 


253 


in the formative and diflScuIt stage in Indo-Pakistan relations in an 
atmosphere surcharged with suspicion, hate and animosity. He 
acquitted himself admirably with his sincerity, innate goodness and, 
friendliness under extremely trying conditions. 

From Karachi he was brought to Delhi and appointed as Minister 
of Commerce -and Industry where he lost himself completely. As a 
minister he was fair-minded but was so gullible that he could be easily 
misled. Neither'was he interested in the subjects he had to deal with. 

Sri Prakasa was successively Governor of Assam, the composite 
state of Madras, and Maharashtra. As a Governor he was excellent. 
His political stature, his endearing old-world courtesy and capacity to 
entertain well, unlike some of the ancient ruins appointed as governors 
recently, stood him in good stead. 

When he was appointed Governor of Madras he asked me if I 
could recommend an elderly woman who could be his house-keeper. 
I spoke to Indira and she, agreed to part v/ith an elderly Danish 
woman who was then in the Prime Minister’s House. Her name was 
Anna Ornsholt. 

Anna Ornsholt was a character. She came to India as a relatively 
young person in search of philosophy. For several years she was a 
companion of Lady Bose, wife of the great scientist Sir Jagadish 
Chandra Eose. Later she became governess of Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit’s 
three daughters. In Allahabad Indira inherited her from her aunt. Jn 
1946, when Nehru moved to Delhi, Anna Ornsholt returned to 
Denmark. In 1948, soon after Nehru shifted to the Prime Minister’s 
House, Indira asked me if she could ask Anna Ornsholt to come back. 
Anna Ornsholt was in correspondence with Indira and had offered to 
return to India at her own expense. Indira said that, apart from food, 
Anna need be given only a small pocket allowance as she would be 
getting an old-age pension from Denmark. Indira thought that since 
her children were small, Anna would be of help to her. I told her that 
Anna was too old; life in the Prime Minister’s House was different 
from what it was in Anand Bhawan; the Prime Minister’s House was 
an oflBcial residence where foreign guests would be staying and official 
parties would be held, and if Aima was excluded from these she would 
feel slighted; if she attended parties and wished to bq present at all 
meals it would be a source of embarrassment. I left it to Indira to 
decide after mentioning the matter to the Prime Minister. She decided 
to ask Anna to come hoping that she would be able to solve some of 
the problems I had posed. 

Anna came. Rajiv and Sanjay used to call her Tantana. She was 
a vegetarian living mostly on raw grated vegetables, some greens. 


254 


My Days with Nehru 


chapatis, nuts and milk products. As I did in Allahabad, I used to call 
her “the squirrel.” Old Anna, with her wrinkled leathery face, did not 
want to be left out of anything. In a couple of years Indira discovered 
that Anna had become too old and was more of a nuisance than 
help. 

Anna Ornsholt, who knew Sri Prakasa personally, gladly joined 
him in Madras. She had a special attachment to south India. After 
being in Raj Bhawan in Madras for some considerable time, Anna 
herself decided to retire from active life. Her departure S3'nchronized 
with Sri Prakasa’s transfer to Bombay. She joined a couple of old 
philosophically-minded Indian friends, acquired a house at Kotagiri 
.in the Nilgiris and settled down there, and subsequently died there. 

In 1952 Sri Prakasa, as the Governor of the composite state of 
Madras, came in for a severe drubbing from Nehru. In the general 
elections of 1952 the Congress in the Madras State fared poorly. Out 
of 367 seats in the State Legislative Assembly the Congress secured 
only 152. The heaviest losses were in the Andhra and Malabar regions. 
Several Congress stalwarts like Chief Minister Kumaraswami Raja, 

M. Bhaktavatsalam, N. Sanjeeva Reddy and B. Gopala Reddy fell by 
the wayside. A formidable opposition led by the indomitable T. 
Prakasam supported by Tenneti Viswanatham, under the name of 
United Democratic Frbnt, emerged. The Communist party had a 
sizeable strength of 63. No party was in a position to form a govern- 
ment by itself. Initially the Congress reconciled itself'to functioning 
as an opposition party, leaving the other parties to come together to 
form a government. This meant the Communist party coming into the 
cabinet as coalition partners which was a prospect disliked by many. 
The Congress had no outstanding leader in the Assembly. In that 
dilBcuIt situation friends and foes of Rajaji in the Congress turned to 
him as the deliverer. Rajaji, who was living in retirement after being 
Governor-General and later Union Home Minister, allowed himself 
to be persuaded by Kumaraswami Raja, Bhaktavatsalam, Kamaraj,, 
Sanjeeva Reddy and others to enter the local fray. His only condition 
was that it should have the approval of Nehru. 

C. Subramaniam and Soundarara Ramachandran were sent to 
Delhi to obtain Nehru’s consent. They approached Nehru through 

N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar. In the meantime Governor Sri Prakasa 
had appraised Nehru of the situation over the telephone. Initially 
Nehru was not confident that Rajaji would be prepared to undertake 
the responsibility. In giving his consent Nehru expressed the hope 
that Rajaji would contest a by-election within six months. 



Some Ministers 


255 


Subramaniam fixed Nehru by saying that this was not so far consi- 
dered. 

, When Subramaniam returned from Delhi and reported that Nehru 
had agreed, Rajaji pointedly asked “did you make any commitment 
on my contesting^n election?.” Subramaniam said “No.” 

Rajaji succeeded in winning over some, splinter groups, including 
the Justice party, and independents and, in the process, did not hesi- 
tate to indulge in horse-trading by promising a ministership to one 
M.A. Manickavelu. This resulted in a slender majority for the Con- 
gress in the Legislative Assembly. 

On the formation of the ministry by Rajaji, Sri Prakasa, who was 
a weak man with poor judgment, was prevailed upon to nominate 
Rajaji, on the advice of the outgoing Chief Minister, to the Upper 
House. This came as a shock to Nehru who felt that he was tricked 
by C. Subramaniam. In later years C. Subramaniam had to pay a 
heavy price for Nehru’s 'distrust of him. After the 1962 general 
elections Nehru family turned down a suggestion to make Subra- 
maniam the Union Finance Minister. Kamaraj also was not in favour 
of it. 

Nehru considered Sri Prakasa’s action as politically improper 
though not constitutionally illegal. He rang up Sri Prakasa and gave 
him a bit of his mind. Poor Sri Prakasa, meek and mild as he was, 
got shaken and ofiered to resign. The crisis, however, below over. 
Nehru never got reconciled to this. It marked the beginning of the 
parting of the ways between Nehru and Rajaji. 

Rajaji, the hair-splitter and onion-peeler, however, had an argu- 
ment even for the indefensible. He talked about shadow and substance 
and about the futility of chasing the shadow. He certainly would have 
found a contrary argument if the situation applied to someone else. 

At an early session of the Legislative Assembly Rajaji clearly spelt 
out his attitude towards the communists. He said that he was their 
enemy number one and that they were his enemy number one, and 
that he would function on that basis all along the line. 

With the separation - of Andhra, Tamil Nadu had a fairly safe 
majority in the Legislative Assembly. But this did not make things 
smooth for Rajaji. Without proper consultation with any one he 
introduced a novel education system in schools on the basis of half- 
time Work with parents. This generated fierce opposition from E.V. 
Ramaswami Naicker and his Dravida Kazhagam.' Even some Con- 
gressmen joined in the chorus of protest. They looked upon the new 
system as a diabolic innovation brought about by a Brahmin to per- 
petuate caste system. In a mood of frustration Rajaji left the govern- 



256 


My Days with Nehru 


ment. He was succeeded by K. Kamaraj as Chief Minister. Progres- 
sively Rajaji became estranged from the Congress and his old 
colleagues and the rest of the story is well-known. 

Sri Prakasa was governor of the composite state of Madras while 
Potti Sriramulu undertook a fast unto death for the creation of .?,n 
Andhra state. When Potti. Sriramulu reached a critical stage and his 
life appeared to be in danger, Nehru happened to be in Bombay. Sri 
Prakasa rang me up after midnight. He sounded a deeply depressed 
and bewildered man. He wanted to speak to the Prime Minister; but 
I said I would not like to wake him up. Nehru did not believe in 
Napoleon’s dictum: “wake me up when the news is bad; good news 
cab wait till the morning.” Sri Prakasa did not wish to insist; but 
within an hour he rang me up again and pleaded with me to wake up 
the PM. I did so with extreme reluctance. As I expected, Nehru 
exploded on the telephone and made it clear that he would do nothing 
under duress. Potti Sriamulu died. Ultimately a new Andhra state was 
carved out of the composite state of Madras. 

After serving a term as Governor of Maharashtra, Sri Prakasa re- 
tired from public life and settled down in Dehra Dun leading a quiet 
life. He passed away in 1971. 

Satya Narain Sinha 

Satya Narain Sinha was a member of the Central Legislative 
Assembly before independence. He became a member of the ^Cons- 
tituent Assembly in 1946 and continued to b'e a Member of Parlia- 
ment until he was appointed Governor of Madhya Pradesh around 
1970. Since 1946 he had been chief whip of the Congress in Parlia- 
ment. On 15 August 1947, as chief whip, he was appointed as Minister 
of State for Parliamentary Affairs. He was an unconcealed partisan 
supporter of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. 

Rafi Ahmed Kidwai was a sworn opponent of Satya Narain Sinha. 
Once Rafi got hold of some information about certain financial deal- 
ings of Satya Narain Sinha and reported it to the Prime Minister. 
Sinha had to do a great deal of explaining before he was let off the 
hook. 

I once told Rafi, while Sardar Patel was alive, that his appre- 
hension that Sinha was dangerous to Nehru was misplaced. I added 
that “I would rather suspect you than Satya Narain.” He asked 'me 
why. I said “imitation is the best form of flattery. See how every new 
sherwani of Nehru is duplicated by Satya Narain; sec how he is 
imitating Nehru by always having a rose bud in button-hole. He has 



Some Ministers 


257 


no ambition beyond becoming a cabinet minister. He is a harmless 
cissy.” 

Soon after Patel’s death, Sinha came to Nehru, while I happened 
to be with him, and said “until the Sardar’s death my loyalty was to 
him. I am a one man’s dog. From now on my loyalty is to you.” The 
Prime Minister told him that there was no need to pledge loyalty to 
an individual, and that his loyalty should be to the organization. The 
attitude of Satya Narain Sinha reminded me of the speech of an old 
Maharaja of Cochin at a banquet to Viceroy Lord Willingdon in which 
he said that the ruling house of Cochin had been successively loyal 
to the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the British.” 

Sinha could think only in Hindi. His speaking in English was the 
result of a quick translation of his Hindi thoughts. For example, 
whenever he telephoned me he would begin by saying “1 speaking 
Satya Narain.” 

Sinha would be uncomfortable if he did not apply Athar (Indian 
scent) on him few times a day. I asked him once how he acquired 
this feminine habit and where exactly he applied the scent. To my 
surprise he confessed that he applied athar behind his ear-lobes. In 
fact most MPs referred to Satya Narain Sinha as Athar." 

Like most of the superficial men, he was anxious to put on an air 
of scholarship. On the slightest provocation he would break into 
reciting shlokas from Tulsidas’ Ramayana. He could also quote from 
Surdas. The peasants of UP also know by heart chunks of Tulsidas’ 
Ramayana. 1 happen to know a woman MP who was considerably 
impressed by “Babuji’s” scholarship. If any one took Sinha beyond 
Tulsidas and Surdas, he would find that he had a barren mind. 

For five years Satya Narain Sinha was at logger-heads with an- 
other Bihari of the same name in the Lok Sabha. The other Satya 
Narain Sinha was a highly-strung person with incredible vehemence. 
He was a teller of tall tales. Many MPs believed him when he said 
that he was a General in the Soviet Revolutionary Army under 
Marshal Timoshenko, and that he was also an ace pilot who needed 
no airfield for landing and take off. People believed him because he 
was lost in Europe for a large number of years. He was the Indian 
counterpart of Baron Munchausen, the world’s greatest liar; but he 
was a harmless fibber. Both the Satya Narain Sinhas accused each of 
opening each other’s personal letters. There were frequent quarrels ini 
the Central Hall of Parliament. 

Satya Narain Sinha belonged to the tribe of Congress ministers 
who either left their wives in their villages or kept them under virtual 
purdah in their temporary Delhi abodes. As men of spiritual qualities 



258 


My Days with Nehru 


and upholders of our ancient culture they believed in the chastity 
of women but not in equality. Their treatment of their wives just fell 
short of African clitorization or enforcing the wearing of Greek 
chastity belts. Sinha chose to leave his wife in the village. 

Some time before the passing of the Hindu Code Bill by Parliament, 
Kamaladevi Chattopadhya and two other elderly women spoke to me 
about “rescuing a young girl from the clutches ofSatya Narain Sinha.” 

I asked them if he had abducted any girl. They said “no”: but they 
gave me a long story. A Hindu refugee family from West Pakistan 
sought the help of Satya Narain Sinha. The eldest unmarried girl in 
the family was an educated and attractive one. Satya Narain Sinha 
employed her as his Private Secretary in the Department of Parlia- 
mentary Affairs. He gave her a car and also helped the family a good 
deal. Kamaladevi said that the girl met her and some others and ex- 
pressed her extreme unhappiness and an earnest desire to sever her 
connections with Sinha. Kamaladevi wanted me to help the girl to get 
transferred to some other government job without loss of emoluments. 
She added that the girl was employed in the All India Radio before, 

I said that since the girl was not in permanent service, finding her an- 
other job would not be easy. At the instance of Kamaladevi the girl 
came to see me in my office in Parliament House and narrated her 
tale of woe. She did not want me to say a word to Sinha. She con- 
firmed everything Kamaladevi had told me and reiterated her desire 
to have another job. 

Somebody who saw the girl in my office, later reported to Satya 
Narain Sinha. He came rushing to see me the next morning. He said 
he was married to the girl and he did so after obtaining the consent 
of his wife and his grown-up children. The only condition they 
imposed was that the girl should not be given anything from the 
family property. He added that he would provide for the girl in other 
ways. He also told me that he was aware of the girl going to Kamala- 
devi and some other women and telling them that she wanted another 
job. I said that the girl saw me at Kamaladevi’s instance and that I 
gathered the vague impression that she might want to see the Prime 
Minister. Sinha was perturbed. I asked him how and when he married 
her and said that nobody had heard of it. He said it was a secret 
marriage solemnised by the two taking vows in front of the image of 
their favourite goddess placed near a tulsi plant. I asked him about 
the relevance of the tulsi plant. 

Satya Narain Sinha asked me if, in view of the possibility of the girl 
seeing the Prime Minister, he should see the PM and tell him every- 
thing. I said it would be in his interest to do so. That afternoon he 



Some Ministers 


259 


met the Prime Minister and told him everything and disclosed that I 
advised him to do so. Later the Prime Minister asked me “why did 
you send Satya Narain to me to waste my time?.” 1 said “he told me 
a long rigmarole and asked me if he should see you. In order to get 
rid of him I said ‘yes’.” The PM smiled. 

Soon after this incident, the girl left Sinha and married a business- 
man who was keen on marrying her for over a year. 

In the last government formed by Nehru, Satya Narain Sinha was 
promoted as a cabinet minister in which capacity he continued under 
the Lai Bahadur and Indira regimes until he was sent out as Governor 
of Madhya Pradesh. In 1977 he retired from public life after a long 
innings. 

N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar (and son G. Parthasarathi) 

Sir N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar and Sir V.T. Krishnamachari were 
two remarkable men the Madras Provincial Civil Service threw up. 
They were almost like two peas in the same pod. Few ICS men could 
hold a candle to them in intellectual calibre and general competence as 
high-level administrators. Both rose to be Dewans (Prime Ministers) of 
important Indian States — ^V.T. Krishnamachari in Baroda and Jaipur 
and N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar in Jammu and Kashmir, 

Gopalaswami was one of the prominent non-party men the 
British Cabinet Mission called in for consultations. He had a remark- 
able memory at an advanced age and this enabled him to prepare 
almost verbatim records of his important discussions with the Cabinet 
Mission and to send copies to Gandhi, Nehru and Sardar Patel. 

The Congress nominated some eminent non-party men to be 
members of the Constituent Assembly in 1946. Gopalaswami was one 
of them. 

More than once Gopalaswami declined to accept Nehru’s invitation 
to join the government on the plea that he would like to concentrate 
his attention on the work connected with the Constituent Assembly. 
The third time Gopalaswami agreed, and on 14 February 1948, joined 
the cabinet as Minister Without Portfolio. After the death of Sardar 
Patel, he became Minister of State and in 1952 assumed charge as 
Minister of Defence. He represented India at some of the interminable 
discussions in United Nations Forums in New York and Geneva on 
the Kashmir question. His performance was far from distinguished. 
He was terribly outshone by Pakistan’s Sir Mohammad Zafifrullah 
Khan. 

Two days before a journey from Dellu to Madras, which turned oul 



260 


My Days with Nehru 


to be his last, he come to my office in the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, 
without notice, to see me. I told him that he need not have taken the 
trouble and that I would have gladly gone to his house to see him. He 
said he was not too well and was going to Madras for a check-up by his 
doctors. He added that before going away he wanted to tell me some- 
thing which I might keep in mind. What he wanted to say was about 
his only son G. Parthasarathi. He said “GP is a friend of yours. You 
know about his education and background. At present he is Assistant 
Editor of the Hindu. He is not particularly happy in the conservative 
atmosphere of the Hindu office. By temperament he is cut out for a 
diplomatic career. Keep this in your mind.” I told Gopalaswami that 
about GP I could not agree with him more and that I was sure that 
opportunities for him would open up. He was visibly pleased with what 
I said. I went down with him to say good-bye. Little did I realise then 
that I was never to see him again. 

Parthasarathi is an Oxford graduate. He was a good sportsman. He 
joined the editorial staff of the Hindu which is owned by his close 
relatives. For a time he was the PTI representative in London for 
liaison with Reuters, and was later the General Manager of the PTI 
with headquarters in Bombay, and after some time reverted to the 
Hindu. I have known him as an agreeable and level-headed person. 

When the International Control Commissions were created for the 
Indo-China states of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, India was to 
provide their Chairmen. Krishna Menon had recommended Foreign 
Secretary M. J. Desai for Vietnam. The posts for the Control Commis- 
sions for Cambodia and Laos were open. I spoke to the Prime Minister 
and suggested the name of G. Parthasarathi for Cambodia. He liked 
the suggestion. He asked me to ring up Parthasarathi in Madras and 
ask him to come over to Delhi. He also asked me to mention the 
matter to Krishna Menon. 

Parthasarathi came. The Prime Minister offered him the Chairman- 
ship of the Control Commission in Cambodia — a post carrying the 
status of ambassador. Parthasarathi accepted. 

In the meantime I had mentioned the matter to Krishna Menon, I 
was aware that Krishna Menon knew Parthasarathi and I was under 
the impression that he liked him. Krishna Menon’s reaction came to 
me as a startling surprise. He said “you always encourage South 
Indian Brahmins, particularly Ayyangars. They can never be trusted. 
You have already committed the mistake of surrounding yourself with 
south Indian Brahmins in the Prime Minister’s office.” I told him 
“south Indian Brahmins happen to be the best PAs in Dellu. I tried 
out several from north India for the Prime Minister; but they could 



Some Ministers 


261 


not keep pace with, the Prime Minister. They have only irritated him. 
The Prime Minister is a man in a hurry and he is impatient and cannot 
brook delay. Yet I have retained some from northern India. Any how 
only about half are from the south.” I told Krishna Menon that it was 
unbecoming of him to condemn a whole community and that he was 
no different from E.V. Ramaswami Naicker of the Dravida Kazhagam. 
He simply replied “you will learn.” I also told him that in any event 
Parthsarathi could not be accused of being narrow in any sense. 

Despite Krishna Menon, Parthasarathi, served in Cambodia and 
later replaced M.J. Desai in Vietnam. Thereafter he had a series of 
high-level diplomatic assignments as Ambassador in Indonesia, 
Ambassador in China, High Commissioner in Pakistan, and India’s 
Permanent Representative at the United Nations in New York. Then 
he served as the first Vice Chancellor of the Jawaharlal Nehru. 
University in New Delhi for five years. His last assignment was as 
Chairman of the Policy Planning Committee in the Ministry of 
External Affairs where he had the ex-officio states of a Ministry of 
State. He continued in government throughout most of the emergency 
period and retired on completing 65 years of age. 

Gopalaswami had the unique capacity for growing out of the 
cocoon of the civil service outlook, while son Parthasarathi grew into 
it. The manner of his retirement is also indicative of it. It did not 
occur to him to resign when emergency was declared. He hung on like 
an ordinary civil servant. The only difference was that he decided on 
his own age of retirement. 

Gopalaswami was one of the few persons to whom Nehru would go 
to clear his mind when a knotty problem presented itself. Nehru had 
respect for his practical wisdom and mature judgment and was 
always sure that he would tender disinterested advice. His death was 
a personal loss to Nehru. 



30 Face to Face With Eternity 


“Dark-heaving— boundless, endless, and sublime. 
The image of eternity” Byron 


Confrontation with eternity is a subject which has always fascinated 
many. What an individual’s thoughts are when he faces death and 
what his last words or last wish, if they can be recorded, are of 
immense value as a clue to his personality. 

Rajkumari Amrit Kaur suffered a severe heart attack one night 
well past midnight in the first week of February 1964. After giving 
her a hot water bottle and telephoning for the doctor, I returned to 
the room and stood by her side. She was not able to speak; but she 
wanted to tell me something. She made a desperate attempt and 
uttered the word “Shummy” and then pointed her finger to her 
cheek. I knew she wanted me to kiss her on her cheek, and I sorrow- 
fully did so. “Shummy” was Colonel Kanwar Sliumshere Singh, IMS 
(Retd), the elder brother of Rajkumari Amrit Kaur — older by eight 
years. He was the brother to whom she was absolutely devoted and 
who always extended protection to her from her girlhood. In uttering 
the word “Shummy” to me, the Rajkumari was reminding me of my 
promise to her that I would remain with him if she preceded him. 
“Shummy” was the last word she uttered before she became uncon- 
scious and died. On a note of unselfishness and consideration for 
another ended the life of a remarkable w'oman. 

Rajkumari Amrit Kaur was born in 1887 and Colonel Kanwar 
Shumshere Singh in 1879. He was 85 when the Rajkumari died. He 
was sent to England when he was seven, lived with an English family 
in Kent and went to prep-school there; then to the famous Rugby 
Public School and on to Cambridge. After taking his degree from 
Cambridge, he studied medicine in London and took the medical 
degree. Then he worked in a London Hospital. He was a good 
cricketer— an all-rounder and played for W.G. Grace’s London 
Country team. He considered W.G, Grace and Ranjitsinhji as the 
greatest cricketers; but was prepared to consider Jack Hobbs, Brad- 
man, Hammond, Hutton and Sobers as tolerably good. He was full 
of cricket stories about W.G., Ranji and others of his time. He con-

sidered cricketer C.B. Fry as the handsomest man with the most 
perfect figure God ever created, and said the when Fry went to the 
pavillion, English Women would rush there in the hope of seeing 
the “perfect Adonis” undressing. The Australian batsman W.L. 
Murdoch arrived for a county match fully drunk and unsteady on 
his legs. Shummy put Murdoch’s head under a tap and released cold 
water. Then Murdoch went in to bat. He made a century. Shummy 
asked him how he managed it. Murdoch said “I saw three balls 
coming to me. I took the middle one.” 

Shummy stayed in England for 21 years at a stretch, got into the 
IMS (he was one the earliest Indians if not the earliest to do so), 
married a tall beautiful English woman from a good family of 
Huguenot stock, and returned to India. He worked till the age of 55 
and left without notice to the authorities when he heard that Firoz 
Khan Noon had decided to give him an extension. He lived to draw 
■pension for 41 years. At the age of 95 he got a tummy upset after 
lunch. He thought that it was the end. 1 happened to be with him. He 
looked at me and said “I am going, my blessings .to you MO” and 
then closed his eyes. I felt his pulse which was good for a man of his 
age. At tea time he was up refreshed. He lived for another year. The 
end came one morning in May 1975. The previous evening he had 
his usual quota of whisky and vermouth and enjoyed himself. In the 
morning he woke up as usual and felt normal. He lay on his back 
after his bed-tea and passed away peacefully without the slightest 
pain or discomfort. One does not normally associate beauty with 
death; but if ever it could be applied, it was Shummy’s. 

Morarji Desai at 82 held forth recently about the secrets of his 
health. I was more impressed by Shummy’s at the age of 96. He 
enjo 3 'ed life in full measure and did everything which Morarji need- 
lessly missed, and still kept perfect health. 

The last words of Christ on the Cross were “It is finished. Father, 
into thy hands I commend my spirit. Father, forgive them for they 
know now what they are doing.” 

Mahatma Gandhi’s last words were “ffey Ram” 

The last words of Socrats were: “The hour of departure has arrived, 
and we go our ways — I to die, and j’ou to live. Which is the belter, 
God only knows.” 

In December 1973, I received, through a third person, a D'pical 
message from T.T. Krishnamachari. Referring to me the message 
said “that rascal MO never gave me a good photograph of Jawahar- 
ial. He has stored them all up. Steal one from him for me)” On 
receipt of the message I sent to TTK the best photograph of Nehru I

possessed. TTK could not write the reply himself, but he managed to 
sign it. The reply dated 23 January 1974 read:

I believe it was the last signature TTK put on paper. His wish that 
dj'ing he should see Jawaharlal was fulfilled. The photograph was 
safeJy'’returned to me soon after. 



Face to Face With Eternity 


265 


While Bertrand Russell was undergoing a jail term during the 
First World War as a conscientious objector, he read about Mirabeau. 
He found Mirabeau’s death amusing. As Mirabeau was dying he said 
•“Ah! if I had lived, I would have given repeats to this Pitt.” Mirabeau 
went on “there is left but one thing to do; it is to perfume oneself, 
crown oneself with flowers, and to surround oneself with music to 
to enter comfortably into this sleep from which one never awakes. 
Legrain, let them prepare to shave me, to do my complete toilet.” 
Then turning to a friend who was sobbing, Mirabeau said “Ah well! 
Are you happy, my dear connaisseur of beautiful deaths?” At last, 
hearing some guns fired, Mirabeau said “Are these already the fune- 
rals of Achilles?.” After that, Mirabeau held his tongue apparently 
thinking that any further remark would be an anti-climax. Bertrand 
Russel further commented that Mirabeau illustrates the thesis that all 
unusual energy is inspired by an unusual degree of vanity; there is 
just one other motive: love of power. 

Long years ago there lived in Tellicherry a clever journalist who 
was the correspondent of the Maldyala Manorama, perhaps the 
•oldest daily newpaper in Kerala. The management held up for an 
unconscionably long time a request for a raise in his emoluments as 
it felt that the correspondent was slack in his work. This reason was 
made known to the correspondent orally. He lost all hope. After a 
month he arranged to send to the paper the news of his “death” over 
the signature of someone else. The news report contained the sentence 
that the last words of the correspondent were “Manorama is my 
only love.” The paper published the report prominently highlighting 
the correspondent’s last words indicating his love for the paper. It 
also published a short editorial praising the qualities of the deceased 
— hard work, devotion to duty and maintenance of high standards of 
journalism, and wound up by saying that in his death the paper had 
lost one of its best and ablest correspondents. A week later the 
“dead” correspondent appeared before the editor of the MalayaJa 
Manorama at Kottayam with a clipping of the editorial. The editor 
•was stunned and promptly sanctioned the increment. The correspon- 
dent’s revenge was complete when he told the editor, before he left, 
“the name Manorama in my so-called last words is that of the girl I 
love and not that of your paper.”

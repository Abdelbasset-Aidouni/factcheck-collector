Liveweb proxy is a component of Internet Archive’s wayback machine project. The liveweb proxy captures the content of a web page in real time, archives it into a ARC or WARC file and returns the ARC/WARC record back to the wayback machine to process. The recorded ARC/WARC file becomes part of the wayback machine in due course of time.

</div>		<p>The government of Uttar Pradesh has decided to prohibit the use of mobile phones inside educational institutions such as colleges and universities of the state. A circular has been issued by the&nbsp;Directorate of Higher Education in Uttar Pradesh&nbsp;that mentions a blanket ban on the use of mobile phones.&nbsp;Students will no longer be allowed to take or use mobile phones inside universities and colleges. The ban is also applicable to teachers across all universities and colleges in the state.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Better teaching environment across all colleges and universities</h1>

<p>The Directorate of Higher Education issued the circular to ensure a &lsquo;better teaching environment for students across all colleges and universities in the state&rsquo;.&nbsp;The government had observed that&nbsp;a large number of&nbsp;students and teachers were found spending their valuable time on their mobile phones during the college hours and hence the government has come up with mobile phone prohibition inside the campus.</p>

<p>This move by the Directorate of Higher Education is aimed at preventing students from getting distracted from their studies.&nbsp;Through this move, the Directorate of Higher Education wants students to focus on studies rather than spending time on their phones. It is unclear what the punishment will be if a student or faculty member is caught using a mobile device on campus.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Ban on mobile phones during cabinet meetings</h2>

<p>Earlier, Yogi&nbsp;Adityanath&nbsp;had banned the use of mobile phones during official meetings that included the cabinet meetings too. The decision was taken after observing some ministers and officials were found to be busy reading messages or fidgeting&nbsp;with their phones&nbsp;during&nbsp;important government consultations which hampered the decorum of the meetings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chief Minister wants all ministers should focus on issues that are discussed in the cabinet meetings. They should not get distracted by their mobile phones. Some ministers have been busy reading messages on WhatsApp during the meeting,&quot; a statement from UP secretariat had read.</p>

Published in <i>The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine</i>, Vol. 3, No. 1,
Spring/Summer 1999. <br>
</center> <p>
<br>
<b> </b>Much of alternative medicine is grounded on vitalism, the notion that living organisms
possess some unique quality, an <i>&eacute;lan vital,</i> that gives them that special quality we call life.
Belief in the existence of a living force is ancient and remains widespread to this day.
Called <i>prana</i> by the Hindus, <i>qi</i> or <i>chi</i> by the Chinese, <i>ki</i> by the Japanese, and 95 other<br>
names in 95 other cultures (Brennen 1988), this substance is said to constitute the source of
life that is so often associated with soul, spirit, and mind. Wheeler (1939) reviewed the
history of vitalism in the West and defined it as "all the various doctrines which, from the
time of Aristotle, have described things as actuated by some power or principle additional
to mechanics and chemistry." Modern theories of vitalism include those of Driesch (1914)
and Bergson (1919). <p>
    In ancient times, the vital force was widely identified with breath, which the Hebrews
called <i>ruach</i>, the Greeks <i>psyche</i> or <i>pneuma</i> (the breath of the gods), and the Romans
<i>spiritus</i>. As breath was gradually acknowledged to be a material substance, words like
"psychic" and "spirit" evolved to refer to the assumed nonmaterial and perhaps
supernatural medium by which organisms gain the qualities of life and consciousness. The
idea that matter alone can do the job has never proved popular. <p>
    Chi or qi remains the primary concept in traditional Chinese medicine, still widely
practiced in China and experiencing an upsurge of interest in the West. Chi is a living force
that is said to flow rhythmically through so-called "meridians" in the body. The methods
of acupuncture and acupressure are used to stimulate the flow at special acu-points along
these meridians, although their location has never been consistently specified. The chi
force is not limited to the body, but is believed to flow throughout the environment
(Huston 1995). When building a house, many believers rely on a <i>feng shui</i> master to decide
on an orientation that is well-aligned with this flow. <p>
    As modern science developed in the West and the nature of matter was gradually
uncovered, a few scientists sought scientific evidence for the nature of the living force.
After Newton had published his laws of mechanics, optics, and gravity, he spent many
years looking for the source of life in alchemic experiments. His search was not irrational,
given the knowledge of the day. Newtonian physics provided no basis for the complexity
that is necessary for any purely material theory of life or mind. This would require
quantum physics. Furthermore, Newtonian gravity had an occult quality about it, with its
invisible action at a distance. Gravity seemed to be transmitted across space with no
intervening matter evident. Perhaps the forces of life and thought had similar immaterial
properties. Still, Newton and others who followed the same trail never managed to
uncover a signal for a special substance of spirit or life. <p>
    In the eighteenth century, Anton Mesmer imagined that magnetism was the universal
living force and treated patients for a wide variety of ills with magnets, a therapy still being
promoted today. He believed that a force called "animal magnetism" resided in the human
body and could be directed into other bodies. Indeed, patients <p>
would exhibit violent reactions when Mesmer directed his energy toward them by
pointing his finger, until the flow of "nervous current" would re-balance the patient's
energies (Ball 1998). Today, "mesmerism" has become associated with hypnosis and
disconnected from animal magnetism or other notions of a living force, but Mesmer's
ideas have survived in various modern "holistic" theories that contradict science. <p>
    In the late nineteenth century, prominent scientists including William Crookes and
Oliver Lodge sought scientific evidence for what they called the "psychic force" that they
believed was responsible for the mysterious powers of the mind being exhibited by the
mediums and spiritualist hucksters of the day. They thought it might be connected with
the electromagnetic "aether waves" that had just been discovered and were being put to
amazing use. If wireless telegraphy was possible, why not wireless telepathy? This was a
reasonable question at the time. However, while wireless telegraphy thrived, wireless
telepathy made no progress in the full century of uncorroborated experiments in
"parapsychology" that followed (Stenger 1990). <p>
    Conventional medicine follows conventional biology, conventional chemistry, and
conventional physics in treating the material body - a complex, nonlinear system
assembled from the same atoms and molecules that constitute (presumably) nonliving
objects such as computers and automobiles. Medical doctors are in some sense glorified
mechanics, who repair broken parts in the human machine. Indeed, any stay in the
hospital reinforces this image, as you are hooked to devices that measure blood pressure,
temperature, oxygen saturation, and many other physical parameters. You are almost
always treated with drugs that are designed to alter your body's chemistry. You usually get
better, every time but once, but, unless you are a physicist, you tend to view the whole
experience rather negatively. <p>
    No surprise, then, that alternative practitioners find many eager listeners when they
announce that they go beyond materialism and mechanism, and treat the really important
part of the human system - the vital substance of life itself. People's religious sensibilities
and images of self-worth are greatly mollified when they are told that they are far more
than an assemblage of atoms - that they possess a living field that is linked to both God and
cosmos. Furthermore, the desperately ill will quite naturally seek out hope wherever they
can find it. So a ready market exists for therapists who claim they can succeed where
medical science fails. <p>
    I must at least mention the highly celebrated recent publication in a major medical
journal of the tests of Therapeutic Touch performed by the schoolgirl Emily Rosa (Rosa
1998). In this simple experiment, TT practitioners were unable to detect Emily's "energy
field." It seems that not only is this field so transparent that no one can see it, the theory
behind it is so transparent that even a child can see through it. <br>
    <p>
<h3><b>UNIFIED BIOFIELD THEORY</b></h3>
The hypothetical vital force is often referred to these days as the <i>bioenergetic field. </i>Touch
therapists, acupuncturists, chiropractors, and many other alternative practitioners tell us
that they can affect cures for many ills by "manipulating" this field, thereby bringing the
body's "live energies" into balance. <p>
    The use of "bioenergetic" in this context is somewhat ambiguous. This term is applied in
conventional biochemistry to refer to the readily measurable exchanges of energy within
organisms, and between them and their environment, which occur by normal physical
and chemical processes. This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They
imagine the bioenergetic field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist
physics and chemistry. <p>
    By "holistic" here, I am not referring to trivial homilies such as the need to treat the
patient as a whole and recognize that many factors, such as the psychological, emotional,
and social, contribute to well-being along with the physical body. While this is often the
example used by those who claim to practice holistic medicine, they imply something
much more is at work in their treatments. Treating the whole person does not contradict
any reductionist principles. Neither does the fact that the parts of a physical system interact
with one another. Reductionism is not about a universe of isolated objects. The holism
that goes beyond reductionism implies a universe of objects that interact simultaneously,
and so strongly that none can ever be treated separately. This concept enters into the
discussion of bioenergetic fields, where that field is imagined as some cosmic aether that
pervades the universe and acts instantaneously, faster than the speed of light, over all of
space. <p>
     Therapeutic Touch and other forms of "holistic healing" are now widely practiced
within the nursing community (Rosa 1994, Schieber 1997, Ulett 1997, Rosa 1998,
Pryjmachuk 1998). These seem to be based on a theoretical system called "The Science of
Unitary Human Beings," proposed by Rogers (1970, 1986, 1989, 1990). According to Rogers,
"energy fields are postulated to constitute the fundamental unit of the living and
nonliving." The field is "a unifying concept and energy signifies the dynamic nature of the
field. Energy fields are infinite and paradimensional; they are in continuous motion"
(Rogers 1990, 30). <p>
    The exact nature of the bioenergetic field is not specified, even as a speculative
hypothesis, in Rogers or the other literature on holistic healing. On the one hand, the
biofield seems to be identified with the classical electromagnetic field; on the other it is
confused with quantum fields or wave functions. For example, Stefanatos (1997, 227)
writes: "The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics. Bioenergetic
medicine is the study of human and animal bodies as dynamic electromagnetic fields
existing in an electromagnetic environment." <p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>AURAS AND DISCHARGES</h3>
Perhaps the most specific model for the bioenergetic field is some special form of
electromagnetism. Advocates claim that measurable electromagnetic waves are emitted by
humans."<p>
In the <i>Journal of Advanced Nursing</i>, Patterson relates "spiritual healing" to the belief that
"we are all part of the natural harmonious energy of the universe." Within this universal
energy field is a human energy field "that is intimately involved with human life, often
called the 'aura'" (Patterson 1998, 291). <p>
Some self-desribed psychics claim that they can "see" a human aura. The claim has not
been substantiated (Loftin 1990). Indeed, humans have auras that can be photographed
with infrared-sensitive film. However, this can be trivially identified as "black body"
electromagnetic radiation. Everyday objects that reflect very little light will appear black.
These bodies emit invisible infrared light that is the statistical result of the random
thermal movements of all the charged particles in the body. The wavelength spectrum has
a characteristic smooth shape completely specified by the body's absolute temperature. As
that temperature rises, the spectrum moves into the visible. The sun, for example, radiates
largely as a "black body" of temperature 6,000 K, with a broad peak at the center of the
visible spectrum in the yellow. At their much lower body temperatures, humans radiate
mostly in the infrared region of the spectrum that is invisible to the naked eye but easily
seen with infrared detection equipment. <p>
    The inability of the wave theory of light to explain the black body spectrum led, in 1900,
to Planck's conjecture that light comes in bundles of energy called "quanta,"thus triggering
the quantum revolution. These quanta are now recognized as material photons. It is
somewhat ironic that holists find such comfort in quantum mechanics, which replaced
etherial waves with material particles." Surely black body radiation is not a candidate for
the bioenergetic field, for then even the cosmic microwave background, 2.7K radiation left
over from the big bang, would be "alive." Black body radiation lacks any of the complexity
we associate with life. It is as featureless as it can be and still be consistent with the laws of
physics. Any fanciful shapes seen in photographed auras emanating from humans can be
attributed to optical and photographic effects, uncorrelated with any property of the body
that one might identify as "live" rather than "dead," and the tendency for people to see
patterns where none exist. <p>
    Stefanatos (1997, 228) tells us that the "electromagnetic fields (EMF) emanating from
bacteria, viruses, and toxic substances affect the cells of the body and weaken its
constitution." So the vital force is identified quite explicitly with electromagnetic fields and
said to be the cause of disease. But somehow the life energies of the body are balanced by
bioenergetic therapies. "No antibiotic or drug, no matter how powerful, will save an
animal if the vital force of healing is suppressed or lacking" (Stefanatos 1997, 229). So
health or sickness is determined by who wins the battle between good and bad
electromagnetic waves in the body. <p>
    Now it would seem that all these effects of electromagnetic fields in living things would
be easily detectable, given the great precision with which electromagnetic phenomena can
be measured in the laboratory. Physics can measure the magnetic dipole moment of the
electron (a measure of the strength of the electron's magnetic field) to one part in ten
billion, and calculate it with the same accuracy. It surely should be able to detect<p>
#How about: Physicists have measured the magnetic dipole moment of the electron (a
measure of the strength of the electron's magnetic field) to one part in ten billion, and
calculated it with the same accuracy. They surely should be able to detect...#<p>
 any electromagnetic effects in the body powerful enough to move atoms around or do
whatever happens in causing or curing disease. But either physics nor any other science
has seen anything that demands we go beyond well established physical theories. No
elementary particle or field has been found that is uniquely biological. None is even hinted
at in our most powerful detectors. <p>
    Besides the infrared black body radiation already mentioned, electromagnetic waves at
other frequencies are detected from the brain and other organs. As mentioned, these are
often claimed as "evidence" for the bioenergetic field. In conventional medicine, they
provide powerful diagnostic information. But these electromagnetic waves show no
special characteristics that differentiate them from the electromagnetic waves produced by
moving charges in any electronic system. Indeed, they can be simulated with a computer.
No marker has been found that uniquely labels the waves from organisms "live" rather
than "dead." <p>
<i>    </i>Kirlian Photography is often cited as evidence for the existence of fields unique to living
things. For example, Patterson (1998) claims that the "seven or more layers within an aura,
each with its own colour," have been recorded using Kirlian photography. <p>
     Semyon Davidovich Kirlian was an Armenian electrician who discovered in 1937 that
photographs of live objects placed in a pulsed high electromagnetic will show remarkable
surrounding" aura." In the typical Kirlian experiment, a object, such as a freshly-cut leaf, is
placed on a piece of photographic film that is electrically isolated from a flat aluminum
electrode with a piece of dielectric material. A pulsed high voltage is then applied between
another electrode placed in contact with the object and the aluminum electrode. The film
is then developed. <p>
    The resulting photographs indicate dynamic, changing patterns, with multicolored
sparks, twinkles, and flares (Ostrander 1970, Moss 1974). Dead objects do not have such
lively patterns! In the case of a leaf, the pattern is seen to gradually go away as the leaf dies,
emitting cries of agony during its death throes. Ostrander and Schroeder described what
Kirlian and his wife observed: "As they watched, the leaf seemed to be dying before their
very eyes, and the death was reflected in the picture of the energy impulses." The Kirlians
reported that "We appeared to be seeing the very life activity of the leaf itself" (Ostrander
1970, 200). <p>
     As has been amply demonstrated, the Kirlian aura is nothing but corona discharge,
reported as far back as 1777 and completely understood in terms of well-known physics.
Controlled experiments have demonstrated that claimed effects, such as the cries of agony
of a dying leaf, are sensitively dependent on the amount of moisture present. As the leaf
dies, it dries out, lowering its electrical conductivity. The same effect can been seen with a
long dead but initially wet piece of wood (Pehek 1976; Singer 1981; Watkins 1988, 1989). <p>
     Once again, like the infrared aura, we have a well known electromagnetic phenomenon
being paraded in front of innocent lay people, unfamiliar with basic physics, as "evidence"
for a living force. It is nothing of the sort. Proponents of alternative medicine would have<br>
far fewer critics among conventional scientists if they did not resort to this kind of
dishonesty and foolishness. (For more discussion of Kirlian photography, see Stenger 1990,
237-241). <br>

<h3>QUANTUM HEALING</h3>
"Quantum" is the magic incantation that appears in virtually everything written on
alternative medicine. It seems to be uttered in order to make all the inconsistencies,
incoherences, and incompatibilities of the proposed scheme disappear in a puff of smoke.
Since quantum mechanics is weird, anything weird must be quantum mechanics. <p>
    Quantum mechanics is claimed as support for mind-over-matter solutions to health
problems. The way the observer is entangled with the object being observed in quantum
mechanics is taken to infer that human consciousness actually controls reality. As a
consequence, we can all think ourselves into health and, indeed, immortality - if we only
buy this book (Chopra 1989. 1993). As I showed in a previous issue of this journal,
"quantum healing" is based on a particularly misleading interpretation of quantum
mechanics (Stenger 1997). Other interpretations exist that do not require any mystical
ingredients (see also Stenger 1995). <p>
    "Einstein" is a name found frequently in the literature on bioenergetic fields. Stephantos
(1997, 228) says: "Based on Einstein's theories of quantum physics, these energetic concepts
are being integrated into medicine for a comprehensive approach to disease diagnosis,
prevention, and treatment." <p>
    Einstein's theories of quantum physics? What theories are these? While Einstein
contributed mightily to the development of quantum mechanics, especially with his
photon theory, modern quantum mechanics is the progeny of a large group of early
century physicists. Planck, Bohr, de Broglie, Heisenberg, Schr&ouml;dinger, Pauli, Born, Jordan,
and Dirac each made contributions to quantum mechanics at least as important as
Einstein's. Einstein's immortality rests securely enough on his two theories of relativity. <p>
    Referring to well known authorities such as Fritjof Capra and Ken Wilber, Stefanatos
(1997, 227) tells how "Einstein's quantum model replaced the Newtonian mechanistic
model of humankind and the universe." Thus holistic healing is associated with the
rejection of classical, Newtonian physics. Yet, holistic healing retains many ideas from
eighteenth and nineteenth century physics. Its proponents are blissfully unaware that these
ideas, especially superluminal holism, have been rejected by modern physics as well. <p>
    Never mind that Einstein was not the inventor of quantum mechanics and objected
strongly to its anti-Newtonian character, saying famously, "God does not play dice." Never
mind that electromagnetic fields were around well before quantum physics and it was
Einstein himself who proposed that they are composed of reductionist particles. And never
mind that Einstein did away with the aether, the medium that nineteenth century
physicists thought was doing the waving in an electromagnetic wave, and a few others
thought might also be doing the waving for "psychic waves." The bioenergetic field
described in holistic literature seems to be confused with the aether. Or, perhaps no
confusion is implied. They each share at least one common feature - nonexistence. <p>
     As the nineteenth century drew to a close, experiments by  Michelson and Morley had
failed to find evidence for the aether. This laid the foundation for Einstein's theory of
relativity and his photon theory of light, both published in 1905. Electromagnetic radiation
is now understood to be a fully material phenomenon. Photons have both inertial and
gravitational mass (even though they have zero rest mass) and exhibit all the
characteristics of material bodies. Electromagnetism is as material as breath, and an equally
incredible candidate for the vital field. <p>
    Much as we might wish otherwise, the fact remains that no unique living force has ever
been conclusively demonstrated to exist in scientific experiments. Of course, evidence for a
life force might someday be found, but this is not what is claimed in the literature that
promotes much of alternative medicine. There you will see the strong assertion that<br>
current scientific evidence exists for some entity beyond conventional matter, and that this
claim is supported by modern physical theory - especially quantum mechanics.
Furthermore, the evidence is not to be found in the data from our most powerful
telescopes or particle accelerators, probing beyond existing frontiers. Rather, it resides in
vague, imprecise, anecdotal claims of the alleged curative powers of traditional folk
remedies and other nostrums. These claims simply do not follow from any reasonable
application of scientific criteria. <p>
     The bioenergetic field plays no role in the theory or practice of biology or scientific
medicine. Vitalism and bioenergetic fields remain hypotheses not required by the data, to
be rejected by Occam's razor until the data demand otherwise. <br>
  <br>
  <p>
<h3><b>THE SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF MEDICAL STUDIES</b></h3>
In my field of particle physics, reputable journals such as <i>Physical Review Letters</i> will not
publish any claim of a new phenomenon, such as evidence for the top quark or the mass of
the neutrino, unless the data have a "significance level" of 10-4 or less. This means that if
the same experiment were repeated 10,000 times, the reported effect would have been
produced artifactually, as a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, no more than once on
average. <p>
     In medicine, and related fields such as psychology and pharmacology, and in the social
sciences as well, the significance level for publication in the best journals is typically five
percent. That is, the experiment need only be repeated twenty times, on average, to have
the reported effect not be real but to result from an artifact of the experiment. This means
that every twentieth paper you read could be a fluke, although many, of course, exceed the
significance threshold and so the fraction of reliable results is probably, thankfully, much
greater. <p>
     This very loose criterion in the human sciences is justified by the very reasonable
argument that any new result should be put to use as soon as possible in case it may save
lives. Indeed, medical researchers are placed under pressures, unheard of in the rest of
science, to make their results available well before they can be confirmed by criteria and
procedures that are quite conventional in other disciplines. Also, in many cases this is
perhaps the best that can be done, given the greater complexity of the human body or
human social systems compared to the typical systems studied in physics. Still, it might do
well for the human disciplines to tighten up a bit. They will avoid much confusion, and
very likely make better progress, as fewer researchers waste time and money following
blind alleys that are suggested by research already "published in peer-reviewed journals." <p>
    We might ask: What criterion should be applied to those studies that claim to show
some therapy works, when that therapy violates well established scientific principles, such
as the conventional laws of physics? For example, should we publish an experiment that
indicates Therapeutic Touch works where the significance level is five percent? I argue
that we should not. Given the difficulty of accurately estimating errors in any human
experiment, any such claims are far more likely to be wrong than one in twenty. One in
one are more likely to be wrong. <p>
    I am not advocating censorship - just tighter standards to apply for any extraordinary
claim, in physics and medicine. When the significance level for bioenergetic fields reaches
0.01 percent, that is, one in ten thousand chances for an artifact, then publish away and
watch physicists scramble for an alternative to their conventional theories of matter. <p>
     If bioenergetic fields exist, then some two hundred years of physics, chemistry, and
biology has to be re-evaluated.  I would insist that any experiment claiming their existence
be forced to obey the same criteria that particle physicists and other forefront researchers
must obey, a significance level of one part in ten thousand rather than one part in twenty.
It is one thing to publish a low significance result that does not violate known principles; it
is another to publish one that forces science to undergo a paradigm-shift and redirect the
limited resources of research to areas that are extremely unlikely to produce any pay-off. <p>
    Much of alternative medicine is based on claims that violate well established scientific
principles. Those that require the existence of a bioenergetic field, whether therapeutic
touch or acupuncture, should be asked to meet the same criteria as anyone else who claims
a phenomenon whose existence goes beyond established science. They have an enormous
burden of proof, and it is time that society laid it on their thin shoulders. <br>

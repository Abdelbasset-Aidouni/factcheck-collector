	  These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.   That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.  
<br><br>
Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.
<br><br>
The goal is to <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/">fix all broken links on the web</a>.

			<h2>Safety and security</h2>
			<h3>Crime</h3><p>The crime rate is lower in Sweden than in most European countries. Petty crime (such as pickpocketing and purse snatching) occurs in areas frequented by tourists, such as Stockholm&rsquo;s Old Town and the Central Station, in restaurants and on public transportation, particularly in urban areas during the summer months. Pickpockets and purse snatchers may work in teams; one distracts the victim and another commits the robbery. Hotel lobbies and breakfast rooms attract professional, well-dressed thieves. Remain vigilant and ensure your valuables are secure at all times.</p><p>Since 2014, there has been an increase in gang and organized crime-related violence in southern Sweden, including in the cities of Gothenburg and Malm&ouml;.&nbsp;In Malm&ouml;, several car bombs were reported at the end of 2014. Grenade attacks on property have been taking place in the city since January 2015. On March 18, 2015, an attack occurred at a restaurant in Gothenburg, killing two people. While these incidents have not occurred in areas typically frequented by tourists, you should monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism in Europe. Terrorists have carried out attacks in several European cities. In Sweden, a previous incident included a truck driven into crowds on a pedestrian street in central Stockholm, causing injuries and deaths. Further attacks in Europe are likely.</p><p>Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, including schools</li><li>places of worship</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant if attending sporting events and during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.</p><p>The Government of Sweden maintains a public alert system on terrorism. The Government communicates threat level changes online and through local media.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180128013920/http://www.sakerhetspolisen.se/en/swedish-security-service/counter-terrorism/threats-and-threat-assessment.html">More information about the local threat</a>&nbsp;- Swedish Security Service</p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations occur periodically and, while they are normally peaceful, have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Avoid all demonstrations, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor local media.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>The road network is excellent. Some roads may be closed in winter, particularly in northern areas. Consult local news and weather reports prior to travel.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Taxis are available. Public transportation is convenient, reliable and punctual. Modern trains operate throughout the country. Extensive and efficient ferry services operate between Sweden and other countries in the Baltic Sea.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180128013920/http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">General information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p><h3>General safety information</h3><p>Exercise normal safety precautions. Ensure that your personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.</p><p>There has been a significant increase in the number of migrants and refugees entering Europe. Some countries have already experienced disruptions to transportation services, including at ferry ports and railway stations, and have seen major delays at border crossings. The situation also heightens the potential for demonstrations that could turn violent without warning, particularly at railway stations and other transportation hubs. If you are travelling in the region, monitor local news and follow the advice of local authorities, and contact your transport carrier to determine whether the situation could disrupt your travel.</p>

					<b>Exercise normal security precautions</b>
					<p>There are no significant safety and security concerns. The overall safety and security situation is similar to that of Canada. You should take normal security precautions.</p>
					<b>Exercise a high degree of caution</b>
					<p>There are identifiable safety and security concerns or the safety and security situation could change with little notice. You should exercise a high degree of caution at all times, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>

						 <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The two levels below are official Government of Canada Travel Advisories and are issued when the safety and security of Canadians travelling or living in the country may be compromised.</p>
					</section>
					<b>Avoid non-essential travel</b>
					<p>There are specific safety and security concerns that could put you at risk. You should reconsider your need to travel to the country, territory or region. If you are already in the country, territory or region, you should reconsider whether or not you really need to be there. If not, you should consider leaving while it is still safe to do so. It is up to you to decide what &ldquo;non-essential travel&rdquo; means, based on family or business requirements, knowledge of or familiarity with a country, territory or region, and other factors.</p>
					<b>Avoid all travel</b>
					<p>There is an extreme risk to your personal safety and security. You should not travel to this country, territory or region. If you are already in the country, territory or region, you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.</p>

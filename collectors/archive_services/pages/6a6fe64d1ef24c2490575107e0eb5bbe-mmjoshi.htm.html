          Murli Manohar Joshi is one of the top three leaders of BJP. He is a 
          scholar, scientist and a mass leader. His early association with RSS 
          instilled in him a purpose in life, a passion for the mission to rebuild 
          India and protect its heritage. </font></font></h3>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Dr. Joshi was born on January 5, 1934. Dr. Joshi had his early education 
          at Hindu High School, Chandpur and completed his higher education from 
          Meerut College and Allahabad University where he was inspired by some 
          of his teachers who used to encourage students for supporting freedom 
          movement. Tilak's Gita Rahasya had a tremendous influence on him. Great 
          RSS leaders like Guruji Golwalker, Deendayal Upadhyaya and Prof. Rajendra 
          Singh played a major role in shaping the young Murli Manohar's political 
          thinking. Specialising in Spectroscopy, he was awarded Ph.D by the Allahabad 
          University. Writings of Vivekananda and Aurobindo had a strong influence 
          on his ideology.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Even during his over four decades of political career, Dr. Joshi pursued 
          his academic life at Allahabad University. He inspired and guided scores 
          of students to take up science research before he retired as Professor 
          and Head of the Physics Department.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Today, Dr. Joshi holds charge of three ministries as India's Minister 
          for Human Resources Development, Science &amp; Technology and Ocean 
          Development. This is his second stint as a Cabinet Minister. Earlier 
          in the first Atal Behari Vajpayee Government in 1996, he was the Union 
          Home Minister. </font></font>

          <b><font color="#FF3300">Accomplishments - As Crusader</font> </b></font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Dr. Joshi is a strong advocate of a modern, strong and vibrant India. 
          Since early days he has been advocating India becoming a nuclear power. 
          He championed the cause of the downtrodden and was arrested several 
          times as Jan Sangh leader, mobilising public opinion and leading agitations.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          On the defeat of Emergency Raj in 1977, Dr. Joshi was elected to the 
          Lok Sabha, and became the General Secretary of the Janata Party in Parliament. 
          Dr. Joshi was in the Rajya Sabha between 1992-96, when he was a Member 
          of important committees like Standing Committee on Science and Technology, 
          Environment and Forests, Committee on Public Undertakings, Select Committee 
          on Patent Law and Select Committee on Trade Marks Bill, Member Standing 
          Committee on Finance, Consultative Committee on Defence and Expert Committee 
          on Low Productivity Areas, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation. 
          As Chairperson of Public Accounts Committee, organised for the first 
          time the Conference of PACs of SAARC countries. </font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Dr. Joshi's commitment to Swadeshi and his deep understanding of economics 
          and WTO issues gave a refreshing dimension to India's approach to the 
          Patents regime. He along with leaders of other non-Congress parties 
          organised the Forum of Parliamentarians on TRIPPS and GATT issues. As 
          its convener, Dr. Joshi closely interacted with Shri Chandrashekar, 
          Shri George Fernandes, Shri Ashok Mitra, Shri Gurudas Dasgupta, Shri 
          Inderjit Gupta, Shri Jaipal Reddy, Shri Rabi Ray and others. This movement 
          largely helped the country in designing its approach to WTO, and also 
          in educating the Indian public on meeting the challenges from the developed 
          world. Dr. Joshi chaired the International Conference on TRIPPS in New 
          Delhi in 1996, where the voice of the developing nations was given shape 
          and thunder.</font></font>

        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          The same conviction guided his actions as the Union Minister for HRD, 
          Science &amp; Technology. For the first time, these departments underwent 
          a paradigm shift in their attitude and direction. Dr. Joshi faithfully 
          translated Prime Minister Vajpayee's emphasis on Jai Vigyan into a concrete 
          action plan. A time bound methodology to make science a popular movement 
          and a political agenda was taken up ever since he became Minister.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Similarly in HRD a number of path breaking initiatives, like free education 
          to every girl child up to graduation, introduction of Sarva Shiksha 
          Abhiyan, Education as a Fundamental Right and Nutrition Mission, popular 
          movement on Sanskrit education, modernisation and computerisation of 
          Madrasas, manifold increase in the allocation for Urdu study, raising 
          the number of scholarships and fellowships in artistic pursuits and 
          updating and modernising curricula.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Both in HRD and Science &amp; Technology Dr. Joshi has introduced many 
          schemes for the benefit of various sections of the society. He introduced 
          India Innovation Fund, Shyama Prasad Fellowships, Stree Shakti Puraskar, 
          special awards and fellowships for women scientists. The National Children 
          Fund is a very significant scheme. Kishore Vaijyanik Yojana is another.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
          the first time the absolute number of illiterate has come down under 
          by 30 million. Under his leadership the literacy level in the country 
          has increased to 65 percent. And a scheme to achieve total literacy 
          by the next decade is now underway. </font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Marine 
          Archaeological findings in the Gulf of Cambay is another major development 
          of this period. In the area of biotechnology significant strides were 
          including that of Human Genetics and Genome Analysis. Jai Vigyan National 
          Science &amp; Technology Missions were also introduced during this time. 
          Special incentives under the Science &amp; Technology were initiated 
          to promote indigenous research and technology. Creating Indian Technology 
          leadership to meet the challenge of the new millennium is a mission 
          with Dr. Joshi. India's traditional health care system, Ayurveda received 
          special attention from Dr. Joshi.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          fact, under his leadership many steps were taken to give special care 
          to women, minorities and weaker sections. Minority education received 
          impetus through modernisation and computerisation of Madrasas and programmes 
          geared towards female enrolment in school. To speed up the literacy 
          campaign innovative proposals were sanctioned. The Constitution Amendment 
          to make Education a Fundamental Right of every child was a step in this 
          direction.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. 
          Joshi was the Chairman of the IT Task Force constituted by the Prime 
          Minister. In pursuance of this 11 Regional Engineering Colleges were 
          upgraded into National Institute of Technology by more than doubling 
          the IT intake. (For details see initiatives Ministry of HRD and S&amp;T)

        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          As in politics, Dr. Joshi played the harmonising role in the field of 
          culture too, when it was part of his ministry between 1998-2000. He 
          picked up the symphony of our rich cultural heritage by getting the 
          nation to celebrate the life and teachings of Buddha, Mahavir, Kabir, 
          Khalsa Panth, Rama Krishna Mission, Sant Jnaneshwar, Chatrapati Shivaji, 
          Mahatma Gandhi, Ghalib, Shrimant Shankar Dev, Firaq and Maharishi Aurobindo 
          as major national events.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          For a philosopher politician Dr. Joshi's greatest asset is his sterling 
          character and clean image. The heights that he climbed have not made 
          him lose his common touch. It has not a bit changed his life style. 
          He leads a fulfilled family life with his wife Tarla and two daughters 
          Priyamvada and Nivedita.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          He is widely acclaimed as the Scholar Politician as also a practicing 
          scientist as a political campaigner. Perhaps his encounter with science 
          began as part of a large social mission. To make science an education 
          stimuli, to refashion the tools of literacy drive, above all a medium 
          to lift the living standards of our people.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          It was his rare organisational skill and scholarly oratory that ensured 
          him his place as a top rung politician. He is equally fluent in Hindi 
          and English with a good knowledge of many other languages like Sanskrit, 
          Urdu, Bangla, Punjabi, Marathi and Gujarati. A regular contributor in 
          many research journals of international repute Dr. Joshi has also authored 
          two books - Vikalp (The Alternative) and Pragya Pravah (The Continuing 
          Wisdom).<br>

          Dr. Joshi is a man of the masses and it is equally true that he has 
          come through the mill. He joined RSS in 1944, at the age of 10. Akhil 
          Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad in 1949 and Bharatiya Jan Sangh in 1957. 
          He offered Satyagraha and got arrested protesting the ban on RSS in 
          1948. In the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad he was All India General 
          Secretary in the early fifties. </font></font>

          Uttar Pradesh, Secretary, B.J.S., Uttar Pradesh, Treasurer, B.J.S., 
          Uttar Pradesh and Vice-President, B.J.S., Uttar Pradesh (prior to its 
          merger in Janata Party). As the General Secretary of the BJP in the 
          eighties, Dr. Joshi was largely responsible for formulating the BJP's 
          economic policy, as enshrined in the Swadeshi Agenda, which the party 
          adopted at its Gandhinagar session in 1987. He was the party's All India 
          Treasurer between 1981 and 1983. </font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
          the All India President of the BJP (1991-93), Dr. Joshi led the historic 
          Ekta Yatra from Kanyakumari to Srinagar, to unfurl the National Flag 
          at Lal Chowk on the Republic Day, 1992. In many ways this along with 
          the Ayodhya movement redefined the course of Indian politics in the 
          nineties. Dr. Joshi played an active role in the Ayodhya movement (For 
          the construction of Ram Mandir at the Ram Janmasthan). He was arrested 
          on 8th December 1992 and detained at Mata Tila, UP along with Shri L.K. 
          Advani and Shri Ashok Singhal in connection with the Ayodhya incidents. 
          The same led to a second arrest in December 1993 when he was detained 
          at Pipri, UP.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          This was not Dr. Joshi's maiden experience in prison life. He underwent 
          19 months of MISA detention when Indira Gandhi clamped Emergency on 
          the nation on 26th June 1975.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Allahabad was the cradle of his political life as also the city of his 
          destiny. For over four decades he has been working in Allahabad. He 
          was elected to Lok Sabha successively thrice from 1996 a record in itself, 
          from Allahabad.</font></font>

          The ancient city of Allahabad also boasts of the most modern IIIT, one 
          of the two under the GoI. This and other modern institutions like K.S. 
          Krishnan Institute for Geo-magnetic Studies were established by the 
          efforts of Dr. Joshi. He helped in establishing (1) Science City (2) 
          Indo-Russian Centre of Bio-Informatics (3) FM Channel Radio Station 
          for Education (4) Rajarshi Tandon Open University at Allahabad. The 
          peaceful and successful conduct of the first Kumbh Mela of the century 
          at Prayag was another major achievement. He has taken up many other 
          developmental activities in his constituency, including the construction 
          of the long pending bridge over Yamuna which have remarkably changed 
          the face of the historic city of Allahabad. Development and fight against 
          corruption were the most important planks of Dr. Joshi's political action. 
          He demonstrated this in ample measure as Member of Parliament, Standing 
          Committee on Finance (1996-97) and as Chairman, Public Accounts Committee.</font></font>

          For Dr. Joshi politics is not a goal in itself. It is a mission. It 
          is a means to serve. It is an instrument of change and vitality -- to 
          make India self-reliant, strong and a proud world leader.</font></font>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Today, Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi has come to epitomize the resurgent India's 
          yearning for self-assertion. He is an ardent advocate of a non-exploitive, 
          egalitarian world order. One is struck by the basic continuity and consistency 
          of Dr. Joshi's approach to politics and to life over the past half century. 
          It is inspired by the desire to wipe a tear from every eye and bring 
          a smile on every face. His deep commitment to the Indian values only 
          makes him more concerned for the weak and deprived. He has stood for 
          combining effective leadership with broad participation to achieve a 
          radical transformation or society. This astute blend of charisma and 
          clear sense of history has made Joshi a darling of the masses. </font></font>
